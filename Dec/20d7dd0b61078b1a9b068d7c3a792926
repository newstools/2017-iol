The 19-year-old singer admitted she is always "influenced" by the 'Formation' hitmaker and thinks the US superstar is a "brilliant role model". She said: "I look up to Beyonce because she's my idol. She's my number one idol and whatever she's doing I will be influenced by it for sure.
 "And then Beyonce happens to be, in my eyes, a brilliant role model. She's so strong and powerful. And she really tells her story her own way.  And she's the boss and she's in charge and all that."   Zara also admired Rihanna, 29, and her "liberating" attitude of pleasing herself without worrying about other people's opinions.
She added to BANG Showbiz: "I also look up to Rihanna for doing whatever she wants to do. It just makes me happy to see a young woman and that's liberating and you know it's great to see to look at women." The 'Never Forget You' singer is keen to team up with some up-and-coming young female singers.
Asked who she'd like to collaborate with, she said: "I would love to do a song with these new cool, young [female] singers . I've been working with so much men and I like to do something with the girls." Meanwhile, Zara recently admitted she'd love to tour the world after recently embarking on a European tour.
She said: "I would love to go to China. I just wanna see what that's all about. I would love to go to Brazil, oh my god Brazil. I can't wait. I heard they are crazy over there so I would like to go over there."  IOL
