Kimberley – Motorists in the Northern Cape can renew their motor vehicle licences at selected post offices from 1 June.The service has, however, not yet been rolled out to Kimberley residents. Spokesperson for the provincial Department of Transport, Safety and Liaison, Keitumetse Moticoe, said on Tuesday the partnership between the department and the SA Post Office was an attempt to take services to the people while also improving service delivery to communities. “The service was previously located with the municipality but now will be rolled out in SAPOs in the Province.” The first phase of the relocation of the service will start at Barkly West, Brandvlei, Calvinia, Keimoes, Kakamas, Kenhardt, Kathu, Olifantshoek, Loeriesfontein and Upington from 1 June. “The envisioned outcome for the relocation of this function is to improve service delivery, reduce long queues and increase accessibility through longer trading hours, including Saturdays. SAPO has a queue management system that reduces waiting time to deliver efficient and effective services. “A further roll-out process in other towns will be announced in due course,” Moticoe said.
