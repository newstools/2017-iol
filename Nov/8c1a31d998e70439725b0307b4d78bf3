According to Marcia Margolius (decor blogger and author), on the home front you will start seeing the use of navy blues, powerful pinks and even minion yellow. “For bathrooms in 2018, simplicity and playfulness is key.” A bathroom is no longer just the plain old basin, toilet or bath. Use your imagination and turn your bathroom into a space that has you feeling rejuvenated and is filled with style and beauty.
 
“Make full use of cladding for floors and walls. The very popular hexagonal design combination (including 3D depths) will add a playfulness element to your space. Make use of texture – with the warmth of wood and contrast with steel enameled basins – this will add a rich sense of tranquility, says Marcia.”
