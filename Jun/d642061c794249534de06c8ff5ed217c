Johannesburg - EFF leader Julius Malema says he has had no interactions with the Gupta family and has never called them to ask for favours. He has promised to reveal more details on the millions of rands that have left government’s coffers illegally. Malema was speaking on online radio station TouchHD on Wednesday.  He said he has tangible evidence involving ANC members and would reveal more information soon.    It has been revealed in leaked emails belonging to the Gupta family, that a number of government officials kept in constant contact with the family. Those implicated in the leaked emails, that showed the extent of the Gupta's involvement in the running of government, include former Minister of Communication Faith Muthambi and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane. Zuma's son Duduzane has also been implicated as a key Gupta associate. Malema said these leaked emails were authentic and questioned why Zuma and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba have not opened criminal charges if they believe the the emails are fake. With the ANC's elective conference in December to elect a new leadership, Malema said whoever is elected should ensure that Zuma goes to prison.  The EFF has for long called for Zuma to step down following the Constitutional Court’s judgement that he had broken his oath of office by not obeying the Public Protector’s recommendations that he had to pay back money he benefited unlawfully from renovations to his Nkandla homestead.  "If Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is elected as ANC president then she must live with the fact that she has to send the father of her children to prison," Malema said.       @ZintleMahlati Politics and Development Hub
