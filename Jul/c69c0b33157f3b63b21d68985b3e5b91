Google is to sell a revamped version of its smart glasses to businesses, nearly  two years  since the original version of the product was cancelled due to complications. Google Glass is a very small, lightweight wearable computer with a transparent display that brings information into your line of sight. Parent company Alphabet's X division continued to develop the technology and has now revealed its efforts in a post on the news site Medium. The company said, “Glass Enterprise Edition had improved battery life and felt more comfortable during long-term wear than before.” The main purpose for the new eyewear is focused around helping people do better at their job. In a work setting, you can clip the device onto glasses or industry frames such as safety goggles so you don’t have to switch focus between what you’re doing with your hands and the content you need to see to do your job. Other improvements on the new eyewear include: a more powerful processor an eight megapixel camera, up from 5MP before the battery life lasts for about eight hours, up from about five hours before improved wi-fi connectivity It will face competition from Microsoft's HoloLens among others. This time, the product will be sold via a range of specialised software companies, which are bundling it with their respective services.
