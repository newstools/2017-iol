"The issue is political purging is continuing..," he told reporters in Klerksdorp. He was explaining his position following his axing on June 1. North West premier Supra Mahumapelo fired Sambatha, saying that it was based on allegations of selling government land illegally in Mahikeng. Sambatha denied that he had sold land, explaining that an allegation was fabricated and conveyed to ANC national officers that he had sold a portion of land illegally. "I have nothing but contempt for lying....government's own records and official documents clearly show that the land in question, No: 2007/248203/23 was sold for R76,440, and it was bought before I was appointed MEC. "In the document they submitted to the national officials, just the first two pages are fabrication. Page 1 is Madoda Sambatha. And in the same document at the office of the lawyer responsible for transfer of land, both page 1 and 2 is Madoda Sambatha and 2016 signature..." He said the land he was alleged to have sold was for rezoning. African News Agency
