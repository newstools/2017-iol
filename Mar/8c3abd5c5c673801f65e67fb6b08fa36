POTCHEFSTROOM – Dane Paterson and Zakhele Qwabe shared seven wickets to set up the Cape Cobras for a much-needed bonus-point win over the Highveld Lions in the Momentum One-Day Cup at Senwes Park on Friday night. Paterson took 4/32 and Qwabe returned 3/38 as the Lions were bowled out for just 188 after winning the toss and electing to bat, before Richard Levi’s quick-fire 85 helped the Cobras to a six-wicket win. Playing just his second franchise game for the Cobras, seamer Qwabe took three wickets in his first spell as the Lions collapsed to 83/6 in the first half of their innings. Left-arm spinner George Linde also played a role, grabbing the key wickets of Mangaliso Mosehle and Dwaine Pretorius and conceding just 19 runs in his 10-over allotment. After Wiaan Mulder (24) and Nono Pongolo (47 not out) had attempted to carry the Lions to a respectable total with a 69-run stand for the eighth wicket, Paterson returned to remove the last three wickets and dismiss the Lions with a single ball remaining in their innings. Chasing a modest target, the Cobras openers took their usual contrasting approaches, with Levi smashing 85 from 60 balls, while Andrew Puttick looked to anchor the innings. The pair put on 125 for the first wicket before Levi fell to Aaron Phangiso in the 19th over. By that stage the result was in the bag, and although Carmi le Roux picked up two wickets in two balls, Puttick’s unbeaten 57 saw the Cobras home in the 33rd over. The result lifted the Cobras off the foot of the table as they moved into fourth position, one point behind the third-placed Lions but having played a game more, and was a welcome boost after their defeat to the Dolphins in Paarl on Wednesday.
