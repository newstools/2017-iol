The Evoque will be available from the third quarter of 2017 with a choice of four two-litre Ingenium engines, starting with the 132kW/430Nm Td4 and the twin-turbo 177kW Sd4, rated for 500Nm from just 1500rpm. The Si4 turbopetrol with electrohydraulic variable inlet-valve lift is good for a claimed 177kW and 340Nm at a nominal fuel-consumption, under laboratory conditions, of 7.3 litres per 100km – which the maker reckons is 15 percent better than the GTdi engine it replaces, thanks to new low-friction technologies. But the hot news, if you’ll forgive the pun, is the 213kW/400Nm Si4, which Land Rover says will launch the Evoque to 100km/h in 6.3 seconds and a top speed of 231km/h, thanks to an uprated turbocharger with high-temperature ball bearing cartridges, rather than conventional journal bearings, for improved transient response and better efficiency. And just so that everybody will know you are driving the hottest Evoque, it’ll come standard with the Dynamic exterior pack of deeper front and rear bumpers, gloss black grille and vents, and 20 inch five split-spoke alloys, also in shiny black. Also available as an extra-cost option will be new sports seats with distinctive horizontally-ribbed, perforated inserts. Discovery(ing) the new Sport The Discovery Sport will be available with a choice of two new engines – the 177kW turbopetrol four, burning a nominal eight litres per 100km in this application, and the 132kW Td4. The seat foam on the Sport has also been upgraded for more comfort and power-adjustable seats now have four-way lumbar support (up from two-way), with 12-way configuration available as an extra-cost option. More options include a contrast roof available in grey or black and a new interior colour scheme in vintage tan leather. Prices, as always, when they get here.
