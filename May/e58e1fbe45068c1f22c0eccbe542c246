"This is not only disingenuous and double standards...but it makes a mockery of the political party system." He accused the DA and the EFF, South Africa's two biggest opposition parties, of extreme "hatred" of Zuma. Mthembu indicated a vote against Zuma was a vote against the ANC. "No party in the world has ever done so. We won't do so." African News Agency
