The announcement marks one of Lourenço’s boldest policy moves since he took power in September and suggests he intends to try and draw a line under years of endemic corruption and impunity.  Lourenço has surprised analysts and diplomats by the speed at which he has sought to take on some of the entrenched vested interests that control sub-Saharan Africa's third largest economy and second biggest oil exporter.  Speaking on Wednesday at the end of a ruling party conference on corruption, Lourenço said a grace period would be announced early next year during which money could be repatriated and invested in the Angolan economy without questions being asked.    Questioned During that period, citizens “will not be hassled, will not be questioned as to the reasons why this money was held abroad, will not be prosecuted,” Lourenço said.   But once that window passes: “The Angolan state will consider itself justified in regarding the money as belonging to Angola and Angolans and as such, together with the authorities of the countries where the money is held, act to bring it back into its possession.”   After nearly 30 years of civil war came to an end in 2002, Angola’s economy grew at a rapid pace thanks to an oil boom which drove GDP to multiply 10 times by 2014.   But rife corruption and mismanagement meant gaping inequality persisted, and a collapse in the price of oil led to an economic crisis.  - REUTERS
