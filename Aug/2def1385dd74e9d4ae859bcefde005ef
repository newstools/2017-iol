But Kim has kept the details of the forthcoming additions close to her chest. And this is not the first time the reality star - who has 20-month-old son Saint and four-year-old daughter North with her husband Kanye West - has hinted more merchandise will be released in the label. She said previously: "This is the start of many amazing products." The news Kim is developing her beauty collection comes as no surprise as celebrity make-up artist, Pat McGrath, has revealed the style icon is "obsessed" with make-up. She said previously: "Kim is one of those rare girlfriends who is truly just as obsessed with make-up as I am." And Pat has admitted she has spent hours talking about cosmetic products with the mother of two, which sees them exchange beauty secrets with one another. Pat added: "We can literally talk about products for hours! We share all our secrets."
