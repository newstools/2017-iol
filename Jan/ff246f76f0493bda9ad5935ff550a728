New York - Mars is buying pet hospital operator VCA for $7.7 billion (R105 billion) in a deal that will tighten the Whiskas and Pedigree pet food maker s grip on the pet care market. The deal will help privately held Mars, better known for candies such as M&amp;Ms and Snickers, add about 800 pet hospitals to its network of more than 900 clinics, which includes the 61-year-old Banfield pet hospital chain. The combination of Mars Petcare and VCA will dominate the veterinary care industry in the US, grabbing an even bigger share of the nearly $4bn global pet care market.

Mars has been diversifying its business as calorie-conscious consumers increasingly shun chocolates and candies, a trend that has weighed on the $183 billion global confectionery market. Mars said it would offer $93 per share, a premium of 31.4percent to VCA s Friday closing price.&nbsp; Reuters
