The drug acts by stopping tumours carrying out repairs to their own DNA, causing the cancer to become weak and die. One of the ways prostate cancer currently gets treated is through therapy that reduces hormones which encourage the growth of cancer cells - but this also stimulates a repair mechanism that can lead to surviving cells becoming more aggressive. However, researchers found that breast cancer drugs called Parp inhibitors, used with anti-hormone treatment, can stop the repair effect. The study, by the Institute of Cancer Research, carried out the tests on human prostate cancer tissue. Lead author Dr Mohammad Asim said: “Prostate cancer is a devastating disease. Our exciting discovery will increase chances of survival for the thousands of men who contract the disease every year.” - Daily Mail
