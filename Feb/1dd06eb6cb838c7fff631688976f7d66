The Cape Argus has developed
a way to help you save water by
cutting down your usage in the
shower. To
help keep
your showers
to a maximum
of two-and-a-half
minutes, they had Acoustic
Element
and Amy
Tjasink write a song. Drip Drop
(the Argus Shower Song) is exactly
two-and-a-half minutes long. Watch the music video below. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
