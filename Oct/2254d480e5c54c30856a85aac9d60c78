The island life is one filled with sheer relaxation and calm. Add a hotel room under the sea  that provides a 360 degree view of the marine life, breathtaking deck where you can view the stars at night and you got yourself an island holiday to remember. While this may seem like a dream, travellers can spend a night or two in an intimate setting at Manta Resort in Pemba Island, Tanzania.  The three level accommodation venue hidden just 250 metres from shore offers lounge area and bathroom facilities, a soft double bed surrounded by panes of glass that affords views of octopus and reef fish. Guests who book the underwater room will be transported on a short boat ride to the location. Once settled, the guests will be shown the ins and outs of their private floating island, and given a kayak, snorkel and fins to enjoy at leisure. Pictures: Manta Resort in Pemba Island, Tanzania.
