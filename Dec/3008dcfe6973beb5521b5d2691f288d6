Nelspruit - The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has strongly criticised a well-known soccer administrator after he was allegedly caught speeding in Mpumalanga over the weekend.
 
The 68-year-old man, who was linked to one of country's top teams, was arrested in Nelspruit in Mpumalanga when he was allegedly driving his Mercedes Benz AMG at 175km/h in a 120km/h zone, RTMC spokesman Simon Zwane said on Sunday. "The alleged conduct of this senior official is completely unacceptable, particularly when considering the high number of soccer players who die on the roads every year. Society expects high profile individuals to be exemplary and this includes respecting the rules of the road," he said.
 
South Africans were urged to stop making excuses and change their attitude to road safety to reduce road accidents during this festive season. The RTMC commended traffic officers for enforcing the law against this official without showing him any favour.
 
"Traffic officers are called upon to be strict in enforcing road rules and accept no excuses from those who break the rules, irrespective of their social status. The soccer official has been released on bail and is expected to appear in court soon," Zwane said.  African News Agency
