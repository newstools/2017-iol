Two weeks back we brought you news that BMW is planning to resurrect the 8 Series in 2018, and now we have a decent idea of how it’s going to look thanks to these allegedly-official leaked pictures of the concept version that’s set to be revealed at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este on Friday. While BMW has said little about the car ahead of its reveal, the company has promised that the sleek new two-door will be a “true luxury sports coupe” and a “genuine dream car”. Although the concept’s styling will be toned down somewhat in its transition into a showroom model, it certainly sets the tone for what could become one of the best looking BMWs in a very long time. The new 8 Series is expected to share its platform with the latest 5 Series and 7 Series sedans and will certainly come with the best and most powerful engines that BMW has to offer, including the next M5’s upgraded V8 petrol. Watch this space for more information as it becomes available. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
