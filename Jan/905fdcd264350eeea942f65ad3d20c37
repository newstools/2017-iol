Johannesburg The Piet Retief Regional Court found a 46-year-old teacher guilty of raping a 15-year-old pupil, Mpumalanga police said on Friday. Spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said Elphas Ndlovu from Piet Retief was found guilty on Thursday. &quot;It all spiralled from an incident that took place in 2001, wherein Ndlovu impregnated a 15-year-old school girl from Piet Retief. He promised the family to pay the damages but disappeared. During February 2002, the family then reported the matter to the police,&quot; Hlathi said. Ndlovu was remanded in custody until February 6 for sentencing. African News Agency
