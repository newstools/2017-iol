If there is one thing you should do before you die, it would be seeing Jessica the Hippo in Hoedspruit. The small town in Limpopo is home to the famous hippo who interacts with humans.  As strange as it sounds, Jessica lives in the river of Hoedspruit and has been raised by her owners, Tonie and Shirley Joubert like their own child. The Joubert family took care of the hippo after their mother was found ill at the border of the Kruger National Park. Despite being able to roam free, Jessica has selected a spot close to the house to be with her human parents. Apparently, they are so close that Jessica sleeps in Tony and Shirley’s house and is covered with a blanket when she sleeps. This rare interaction between human and  hippo has made Jessica famous. The beauty has starred in over 90 films and documentaries. Those who want to visit Jessica can visit her at her Hoedspruit house. Photo opportunities are available for anyone who wants to stroke her nose or feed her. Watch Jessica here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSM866wIyp4
