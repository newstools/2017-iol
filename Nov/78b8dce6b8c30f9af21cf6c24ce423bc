Johannesburg - After wowing the world with its latest-generation XC90 and XC60 SUVs, Volvo will be hoping to create a buzz in the compact crossover segment with its first-ever XC40. The newcomer is set to hit South African shores in April 2018. Although exact pricing has yet to be finalised, Volvo South Africa has announced that once all engine and trim derivatives come on stream, the range will retail from below R500 000 to somewhere around the mid-R600 000 mark. The cheaper models won’t be available initially however, as Volvo plans to kick off with only the higher-end 182kW T5 petrol and 140kW D4 diesel engines, available with either Momentum (baseline) or the sporty R-Design trim grades. The more affordable engine options, in the form of T3 (115kW) and T4 (140kW) petrols as well as a D3 (110kW) diesel will come on stream later in 2018, along with the luxurious Inscription trim grade on various models. All engines are 2-litre, four-cylinder turbocharged units and the T4, T5 and D4 all come with all-wheel drive and an automatic gearbox, which are also available as an option on the D3, while the T3 is a manual, front-wheel-drive deal only. Buyers will be able to personalise their XC40 with options like contrasting black or white roof colours, white mirror caps and wheels, ‘Lava’ carpets and Oxide Red leather upholstery. Cabin electronics include a digital instrument cluster and Volvo’s 22.8cm Sensus touchscreen infotainment system with various connected apps - including one that allows you to control various functions remotely from your smartphone or watch. This is standard on European models, along with a long list of driver assist gizmos such as City Safety auto-braking with pedestrian, cyclist and animal detection, and Volvo’s Oncoming Lane Mitigation with steering assistance. Furthermore, Volvo’s Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving feature is available as an option. Exact local specifications will be disclosed closer to launch. IOL Motoring RELATED VIDEO
