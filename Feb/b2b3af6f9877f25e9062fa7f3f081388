Pule Patrick Mile, the defence attorney of nine illegal immigrants who had been sentenced to eight months imprisonment, was arrested on Friday. In a statement on Monday, Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) spokesperson, Captain Philani Nkwalase, said: "He allegedly sped off, despite the attempts made by a police officer to apprehend two of the nine illegal immigrants allegedly seen leaving Welkom Magistrate's court on 27 January 2016 in his vehicle." However, the police officer who allegedly facilitated the getaway, brought the suspects back the same day. Nkwalase said: "Upon their return, Sergeant Tumelo Daniel Lehokoe, 33, was arrested and he appeared before Welkom Magistrate's Court on 30 January 2017." "They were both released on R3 000 bail and are both expected to appear in Welkom Magistrate's Court on 28 February 2017," he said. African News Agency
