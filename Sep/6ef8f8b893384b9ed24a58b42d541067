CAPE TOWN - Handré Pollard (flyhalf) and Damian de Allende (centre) are amongst seven Springbok players released to play in the Currie Cup this coming weekend, it was confirmed on Monday. The Springbok duo will join Dillyn Leyds (utility back), Wilco Louw (prop, both DHL Western Province), Chiliboy Ralepelle (hooker), Dan du Preez (loose forward, both Cell C Sharks) and Rudy Paige (scrumhalf, Vodacom Blue Bulls) in Currie Cup action for the respective provinces this weekend. Pollard came on as a second half replacement for the Springboks against the All Blacks on Saturday in Albany, his first Test appearance since the 2015 Rugby World Cup. He has struggled with an ankle injury for the most part of the season, which limited his playing time. De Allende has been a member of the national squad this year but he too has seen limited action behind the Springboks’ preferred centre pairing of Jan Serfontein and Jesse Kriel. Meanwhile, the Springboks arrived home on Sunday evening from their two away matches in Australia and New Zealand. The squad will reassemble on Sunday in Bloemfontein for their next home match, against the Wallabies, at Toyota Stadium on Saturday, 30 September. The Boks will complete their 2017 Castle Lager Rugby Championship campaign on Saturday, 7 October with a rematch against the All Blacks at DHL Newlands in Cape Town. The following Springbok squad members have been released for Currie Cup duty: Damian de Allende (centre), Dillyn Leyds (utility back), Wilco Louw (prop, all DHL Western Province), Chiliboy Ralepelle (hooker), Dan du Preez (loose forward, both Cell C Sharks), Handré Pollard (flyhalf) and Rudy Paige (scrumhalf, both Vodacom Blue Bulls).
