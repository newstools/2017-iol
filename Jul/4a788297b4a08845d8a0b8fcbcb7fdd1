Russelsheim, Germany - With less than a week to go before the reveal of Hyundai’s first hot hatch, the i30 N, this short teaser video reveals quite a lot of detail, without any camouflage.   Neat red strips on the front bumper and the rear diffuser underline the N’s status at the top of the i30 range, as do red brake callipers behind noticeably bigger rims than on the cooking version. What we do know is that the i30 N will come with two versions of a two-litre turbopetrol four, one rated for 184kW, the other with 202kW and a limited-slip differential, each driving the front wheels via a six-speed manual ‘box - although we have been promised a dual-clutch transmission down the line.
