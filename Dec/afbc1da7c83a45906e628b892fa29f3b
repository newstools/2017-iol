Stanley Menzo has quit as coach of Ajax Cape Town. Considering the precarious nature of the Cape club’s position towards the basement of the PSL standings, his decision is no surprise. In a statement on Thursday morning, the club said: “Ajax Cape Town Football Club and head coach Stanley Menzo have mutually agreed to part company with immediate effect. After a year at the helm, Menzo was unable to find consistency from his team which he has led to 15th position on the Absa Premiership log standings after 14 matches this campaign.”  Menzo, a former goalkeeper with Ajax Amsetrdam and the Netherlands, has great experience in the game and understands the vagaries of the job. His decision was made for the benefit of the club.  “I think that a coaching change is possibly the best for the club right now as we get to the critical part of the season,” said Menzo. “I would also like to thank the club for the opportunity that was given to me and to also thank all the staff and players who always supported me. “A special mention to the fans for their great support even at times when things were really not going well. I wish the club the best for the remainder of the season.” Ajax are set to announce a replacement within the next few days. @Reinerss11  IOL Sport  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
