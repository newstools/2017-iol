 London - Five years ago Kaci Sullivan was delighted to become a mother after giving birth to a son. And now, Kaci has given birth to a second child â€“ but this time as a transgender man. He is believed to be the first person in the world to give birth as a woman and then again after having transgender  surgery. Mr Sullivan, 30, had Grayson by his ex-husband, giving birth as a woman. He then came out as transgender, which led to the break-down of his marriage. In 2013 he began transitioning from female to male by taking the hormone testosterone and undergoing a double mastectomy.   He then met his current partner Steven. They decided to have a baby and conceived naturally as Mr Sullivan still has a womb. He gave birth to baby Phoenix on November 11.  Daily Mail
