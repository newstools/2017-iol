Speaking previously about her fashion ventures, Eva - who is married to Jose Baston - said: "People keep asking me why it's taken me so long to do a clothing line, because I've been wanting to do it forever." And the American star has revealed she has waited to release a fashion range because she only ever wants to throw herself whole-heartedly into the creative process. She explained at the time of her first launch with The Limited: "I was offered a lot of different deals - it was basically to just put your name on something. But I wanted to be part of the process. I wanted to design, I wanted to help in the sourcing, I wanted to be involved in buying the artwork (for prints and graphics), everything. And to do that, it is its own full-time job." And Eva has revealed it has been a "lifelong project" of hers to join the fashion industry because she has been sewing since she was seven years old.
