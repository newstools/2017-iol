Johannesburg - Porsche South Africa has announced the local pricing and launch timing for the Turbo S E-Hybrid version of the Panamera Sport Turismo, which was unveiled last week. The wild new 500kW wagon will go on sale in South Africa in January 2018, priced at a cool R2 973 000, including a three-year drive plan. As reported last week, the Sport Turismo Turbo S E-Hybrid is powered by the same hybrid drivetrain as its Panamera fastback sibling, which mates a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine to an electric motor for system outputs of 500kW and 850Nm, allowing a (claimed) 3.4-second zero to 100km/h sprint and 310km/h top speed. Power goes to all four wheels through an eight-speed PDK gearbox and Porsche Traction Management adaptive all-wheel-drive system and if plugged in to a wall socked beforehand, the vehicle can cover up to 49km on electric power alone. The Sport Turismo also sports an adaptive roof spoiler, which is set to one of three different angles depending on the driving situation and vehicle settings, and which can generate an additional 50kg of downforce on the rear axle. Standard kit on the Turbo S E-Hybrid includes adaptive air suspension, Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control and Porsche Active Suspension Management, Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus rear diff lock, Sport Chrono Package, 21-inch alloy wheels and ceramic composite brakes. Furthermore, this model can also be ordered with Porscheâ€™s rear-axle steering. IOL Motoring
