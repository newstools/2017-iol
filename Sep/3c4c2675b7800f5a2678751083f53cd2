CAPE TOWN – Orlando Pirates defender Happy Jele has apologised to the club and their supporters after being arrested for speeding in Johannesburg early on Monday morning. Jele was detained by Gauteng provincial traffic police on the M1 near Sandton for driving at an average speed of 223km/h in his BMW 135i in a 120km/h zone. The Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane said earlier on Monday that Jele had stated that he was speeding to get to his sick child, which was later proved not to be the case. Jele appeared in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on charges of reckless driving and exceeding the speed limit, and was released on bail. He then expressed his remorse in a statement released by Orlando Pirates late on Monday night. “I refer to the news of my arrest this morning, which is making rounds in the media. It is true I was apprehended by the enforcement law agency driving at high speeds,” Jele said. “I was taken into police station for statements and procedures, from which I was released on bail. “I would like to sincerely apologise for my recklessness and bringing the Club into disrepute and take full responsibility of my actions. “I have no excuse for my action and I can only wish the Club, the supporters and the public at large to accept my apologies as I realise the number of people I have disappointed. “Happy Quinton Jele.” However, social media was abuzz with memes about Jele’s misdemeanour.   The 30-year-old Jele has been at Orlando Pirates since 2006, and has played for Bafana Bafana as well. Pirates’ next match is on September 12 against Ajax Cape Town at Orlando Stadium, so it remains to be seen whether Jele will be selected by coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic. @ashfakmohamed  IOL Sport  Like IOL Sport on Facebook
