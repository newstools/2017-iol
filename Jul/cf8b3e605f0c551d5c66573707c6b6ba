Hiroshima, Japan - Mazda has released the first picture of its new CX-8, and like the smaller CX-4 that is being sold in China only, the newcomer lacks any globe-trotting ambitions, except this one will be restricted to the Japanese market. The CX-8 is slightly smaller than Mazda’s CX-9, which is an export-only model that’s not sold in its home market, meaning the CX-8 is likely an adaptation created specifically for Japanese tastes. Or will Mazda eventually change its mind and offer it elsewhere? Given the world’s ever-growing appetite for SUVs, it certainly can’t be considered impossible. While closer in size to the CX-9, the CX-8 shares more styling similarities with the CX-5, and is also powered by Mazda’s familiar 2.2-litre turbodiesel engine. The CX-8 also offers an interesting six-seat interior layout, with cosy-looking individual middle-row seats separated by an armrest and console.
