Is this the end of the road for Robert Marawa at SABC? Seasoned sportscaster Robert Marawaâ€™s career at the SABC may be coming to an end. Marawa's future is on shaky ground after he went AWOL following his radio producer Beverly Maphanga getting suspended last week. It is alleged that the public broadcaster has scheduled a meeting with the Metro FM sports anchor this week. According to a Sunday publication, SABC's group executive for sports Sully Motsweni was not impressed with Marawa's behaviour and has informed senior executives that she plans to summon Marawa to a meeting where she intends to serve him with a letter of termination of his contract for "misconduct". "They can fire me without having to call me to a meeting if there are substantive grounds to warrant a firing. The tweets were factually correct in explaining what's happening. Which tweet touched them in their studio?" said Marawa  Maphanga landed in hot water for playing the audio clip from the broadcasterâ€™s competitor, SuperSport. The clip was of Sizwe Mabena and was played during Marawaâ€™s Metro FM show. Following the incident, Marawa went MIA and went on to social media to express his frustration. He tweeted that he "had removed himself from the show". Marawa added that he would not be on his show because of Maphangaâ€™s suspension. Radio 702's talk show host, Redi Tlhapi offered Marawa to jump ship: Come work here. We speak about and quote our so-called "competitors" when it's relevant. No consequences. No egos here.
