JOHANNESBURG – Mannequins wearing jerseys of past Nedbank Cup winners, from Mamelodi Sundowns who won the inaugural edition in 2008 to the reigning champions SuperSport United, formed a guard of honour that welcomed guests in Sandton at the bank’s offices, which hosted the last-32 draw. But those teams and other Premier Division teams won’t have any carpet rolled out for them when this tournament starts in the first week of March. There were a number of potential banana peels that were thrown to teams like Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns. The Soweto giants have been knocked out by teams from the lower leagues before, so they will be careful when they start this campaign. Amakhosi will visit first division side Stellenbosch United, while Pirates will go to the Eastern Cape to take on amateur side EC Bees. Sundowns will start at home against Safa league side Mariveni United from Limpopo. One amateur team that won’t forget Sundowns in this tournament is Powerlines FC, who were hammered 24-0. The champions Matsatsantsa a Pitori will face first division side Royal Eagles.  njabulo.ngidi@inl.co.za  @NJABULON Full Draw Platinum Stars v AmaZulu EC Bees v Orlando Pirates Mamelodi Sundowns v Mariveni United FC Cape Town v Baroka Free State Stars v Highlands Park Cape Town All Stars v Bidvest Wits Chippa United v Witbank Spurs Buya Msuthu FC v Bloemfontein Celtic Golden Arrows v Maritzburg United Polokwane City v African All Stars Royal Eagles v SuperSport United Jomo Cosmos v United Rovers Stellenbosch United v Kaizer Chiefs Arconbush United v Cape Town City KwaDukuza United v Ajax Cape Town Days FC v Mbombela United
