Johannesburg - Mitsubishi has given its Outlander a mid-cycle makeover, focusing mainly on cosmetics and features to create an SUV that looks (and sounds) different without investing in a major engineering redesign. The front treatment has been updated with the brand’s new  ‘Dynamic Shield’ design language - first seen in South Africa recently on the updated ASX, placing the triple-diamond logo above the middle of the grille, which is outlined by two chromed strakes that taper down to the foglights. This framing is echoed at the rear by chrome details surrounding the tail-lights, styled to create the impression that they also frame the Mitsubishi badge. Inside, there’s a 710W eight-channel Rockford Fosgate sound system with nine speakers, including a subwoofer, and a 23cm roof-mounted DVD player with a fold-down screen that’s visible from both the second and third rows - whose occupants can listen to the sound track via either car’s audio system or through cordless infrared headsets, depending on the length of fuse of the flight-deck crew. Said crew are equipped, as before, with a fully adjustable multi-function steering wheel, paddle shifters, Bluetooth connectivity and voice control with a central touchscreen for infotainment functions and a separate digital display in the instrument cluster for vehicle-related data. Mechanical underpinnings are unchanged, with Mitsubishi’s familiar 2.4 litre, 16-valve twin-cam MiVec petrol four, rated at 123kW and 222Nm, doing duty via continuously variable transmission with six-step Sports Mode shift control to give the illusion of a manual shift when required. Its multi-select all-wheel drive system offers three modes - Eco, Auto and Lock - which do pretty much do exactly what their names imply. At R549 900 the new 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander - available now - comes with a three-year or 100 000km warranty, and a five-year or 90 000km service plan based on service intervals of 15 000km.
