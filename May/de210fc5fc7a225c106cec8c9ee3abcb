   Safa announced late on Wednesday that they have come to an agreement with the “successful candidate” to take over from Shakes Mashaba as the new Bafana Bafana head coach.  The South African national team have been without a full-time head coach since December, after Mashaba was fired for, among other things, criticising the Safa top brass, including president Danny Jordaan, for a supposed lack of support.  It is known that Safa have been trying to secure the signature of SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter for a number of weeks now, and while the organisation didn’t name the new coach on Wednesday for legal reasons, Baxter is the likely candidate.  If that is the case, the Scottish national will enjoy a second stint at the helm of Bafana, having previously been in the role in 2004-05.  “Following a thorough, but lengthy process of seeking a replacement head coach for the men’s senior national team, Bafana Bafana, the Association is pleased to announce that it has finalised an agreement with the successful candidate, and is in the process of formalising the legal arrangements by exchanging signatures today,” Safa said in a statement.  “We are mindful that the South African public has been waiting with bated breath for this matter to be concluded, and we can report that we will make a formal and more detailed announcement to this effect in the next 24 to 48 hours.”  More to follow…  Independent Media    Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
