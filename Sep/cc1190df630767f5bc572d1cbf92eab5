"Welcome to Hell" — those are the words that greet you when you visit Wang Saen Suk Hell Garden. Wat Saen Suk or Wang Saen Suk Monastery Garden is a buddhist temple located in Bang Saen city, Chonburi province, Thailand. A popular tourist attraction, it is meant to describe and depict Naraka. Located at Bang Saen Sai 2 Soi 19, Saen Suk, Chon Buri. The garden is filled with gore, with statues of people being tormented and pierced for their actions. Visit here if you not scared of getting nightmares once you leave as even locals are a bit afraid of the place. According to TripAdvisor user David B, this Buddhist Temple was designed to illustrate the joys of following in the path of the Lord Buddha, and the torment, trial, torture and tribulations awaiting in Hell for those who transgress. In his review, he said: “..this "theme park" approach to the teaching of Buddha has more to do with the fertile imagination of some modern Buddhist monks than it does to the Buddha himself. “As I was leaving I came face-to-face with the harsh reality that hell is not some imaginary place after death. For some, it is here and now on earth,” he wrote. A walk through the garden can take up to 45 minutes and is signed in English to help tourists understand.
