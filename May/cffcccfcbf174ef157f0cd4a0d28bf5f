“Fuzile is expected to leave the department some time in May,” Treasury said in a statement. “The position was advertised and closed on the 28th April 2017. More than thirty applications have been received, including internal candidates.” Fuzile’s contract was meant to end in May 2016, but shortly before the axing of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, he asked for a redetermination of this contract. The exit date was set as May 15 this year. Fuzile’s contract was extended for a two-yearr term in 2016, after Gordhan returned to National Treasury. African News Agency
