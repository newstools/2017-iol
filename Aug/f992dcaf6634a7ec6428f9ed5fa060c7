New York - U.S. cable channel HBO said on
Monday that hackers had stolen upcoming programming, and
Entertainment Weekly reported that the theft included a script
for an unaired episode of the hit fantasy show 'Game of
Thrones'. HBO, a unit of Time-Warner Inc, declined to comment
on the specific programming stolen in the hack. "As most of you have probably heard by now, there has been a
cyber incident directed at the company which has resulted in
some stolen proprietary information, including some of our
programming," HBO Chairman Richard Plepler wrote in a message to
employees, which the company shared with reporters. The company declined to comment on reports that unbroadcast
episodes and scripts were among the data hacked, citing an
"ongoing investigation" by unspecified law enforcement
officials. Entertainment Weekly reported that hackers stole 1.5
terabytes of data and had already posted online unbroadcast
episodes of "Ballers" and "Room 104," along with "a script or
treatment" for next week's episode of "Game of Thrones." Reuters also received an e-mail on Sunday from a person
claiming to have stolen HBO data, including "Game of Thrones." The show is now in its seventh season and due to wrap up
next year.
