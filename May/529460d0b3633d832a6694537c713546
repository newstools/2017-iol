RUSTENBURG – Platinum Stars added to the relegation woes of Highlands Park as they scored late in a 1-0 Absa Premiership win at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Sunday. Stars used their Malawian midfielder Robert Ng’ambi as a game-breaker, and that is exactly what he did when he came on as a second-half substitute and rose high to head home from a corner kick taken by Ndumiso Mabena in the 87th minute. The North West side could well have been at least two goals up by this stage, with striker Mabena having been unlucky in the 52nd minute, when his powerful shot struck the Highlands crossbar with goalkeeper Marlon Heugh well-beaten. Highlands’ best chance came in the 35th minute when Stars’ Kamogelo Mathe cleared an effort from Highlands’ Mthobi Mvula off the goal line. Stars’ goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela also had to pull off a strong save from a goal-bound strike from Lindokhule Mbatha in the 68th minute. Highlands remain bottom of the league table with 22 points from 27 games. The three points obtained by Stars has all but secured their top-flight status as they are on 29 points from 27 games.
