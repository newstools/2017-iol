Police Minister Fikile Mbalula held a meeting with residents, religious leaders and councillors where he announced a new station commander, Bongani Mtakati, for the Philippi East police station. Mtakati said he was looking forward to working with the leadership of Marikana and surrounding areas. He said tomorrow he would meet the community to outline a working relationship. “I will establish sub-forum neighbourhood watches and recruit reservists within the community,” said Mtakati. Marikana residents painted a bleak picture of crime in their area and told Mbalula that police refused to enter the informal settlement. On Friday night, a group of men, believed to be linked to a gang, shot dead 11 people believed to be linked to community patrols. The shootings were apparently an act of revenge after night patrollers allegedly killed 12 suspects. Marikana community leader Joseph Makeleni told Mbalula that criminals were taking advantage of the lack of floodlights in the area. He said criminals worked with certain police officers to acquire guns. He feared his life was not safe as he was talking openly about these events. Ward councillor Nelisile Chitha said he feared the shootings and vigilantism would result in more deaths. “We know the people who are doing these killings but we are hiding them, enough is enough.” Community Policing Forum provincial board chairperson Andrew Lyon said communities should not have to take responsibility for ridding their areas of crime. “To what extent is this (the crime in Marikana) affecting the police? There are no floodlights in Marikana. We can’t keep fighting for the rights of black people. If this was Constantia, it never would have happened.”
