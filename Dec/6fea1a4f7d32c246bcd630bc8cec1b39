He was identified by the blue check shorts he was wearing. It appears his killers had buried the child in a shallow grave near the bridge on Symphony Way and then made a fire on top of it. Chad Abrahams went missing from his Wallace Street home on Monday after he was apparently kidnapped by two men.  According to a neighbour, the men had dragged him off, but nobody intervened. On Tuesday, one of his friends went to his granny, saying that he thinks Chad was killed and buried in the bush. Delft police descended on the area the same day and the teen’s body was found on Wednesday morning. It’s believed he was beaten to death. Grandmother Ingrid Abrahams says she has no idea why anyone would kill her grandson. “I went to the police on Tuesday to open a missing person’s case. I went looking for Chad everywhere, but nobody saw him and then a lady who lives close by came and told me two men had dragged him away,” says Ingrid. The grandmother says Chad’s mother died when he was five, and she raised him and two other siblings. “Everyone knew him and everyone liked him. He was lovable and was mostly in the house or outside with his friends. He was always full of jokes and people loved that about him,” she says.  “He was not at school anymore, but he was a good boy, who always obeyed me. I got worried on Monday after he did not come home. It is not like him to just say nothing and disappear,” says the heartbroken granny. Captain FC van Wyk says it was Chad’s body. “The deceased was identified by his grandmother who had reported him missing  (on Tuesday),” he said.  “He sustained a wound to the right side of the head and swollen face. At this stage the motive is unknown and no one has been arrested.”  Daily Voice
