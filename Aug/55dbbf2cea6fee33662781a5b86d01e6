Jakarta - Datsun has given its Go hatchback a dose of visual excitement with the creation of the Go Live concept car that was revealed on Thursday at the Indonesian International Motor Show. Datsun says the concept was created specifically for young Indonesians “who see customizing vehicles as a way of life,” although its appeal could certainly stretch to other markets. No engine mods have been mentioned however, so this is clearly an aesthetic makeover only, but Datsun has at least taken that aspect quite seriously with bold new bumpers, ‘canted’ headlights, flared wheel arches housing 17-inch alloys and a huge rear wing, among other bold decorations. The colour scheme also makes quite a statement, with bright yellow accents on the lower body and wheels and a camo-style silver paint scheme inspired by modern clothing and accessories. “The car reflects the fun, expressive and liberating attitude that Indonesian car enthusiasts have toward their vehicles,” said Datsun design director Kei Kyu. “Jakarta is such an exciting place, and we wanted to capture the power and passion of the city with this car.” No word on any production potential at this stage, but the concept certainly implies that Datsun might be considering some youthful new editions for its customers.
