Nürburg, Germany - Just two days after revealing the concept version of its forthcoming 8 Series, BMW decided to show off the M8 version in prototype form, albeit fully camouflaged. Revealed on the Nürburgring ahead of the weekend’s 24-hour race, the working prototype shows us the new 8’s basic silhouette, broad shoulders and large kidney grille. In keeping with its M status, the most potent 8 Series will have larger air intakes and a sports exhaust system with four tailpipes. BMW remains secretive about what’s under the bonnet, but word on the street is that it’ll get a modified version of the next M5’s twin-turbo V8, while also borrowing its sibling’s new all-wheel drive system. It remains to be seen how that would fit alongside the rumoured M860i version, which features the M760Li’s 448kW force fed V12, but if the latter does happen, the M division would surely need to tune the M8’s eight-cylinder motor somewhat beyond the 450kW mark.
