This loose and shambling tale with a very attractive cast is highlighted by a wonderfully wacky, show-stealing turn by Daniel Craig as a down-home career criminal. Channing Tatum is Jimmy Logan, a heavy equipment operator who loses his job, has forfeited all custody rights to his daughter and has no prospects when he heads over for a drink at the roadside bar tended by his Iraq War vet brother Clyde (Adam Driver). So what do these down-on-their-luck good ol’ boys do to turn things around? Jimmy’s bright idea is to rob the mother lode of Nascar, the Charlotte Motor Speedway, during the Coca-Cola 600 on Memorial Day weekend. An ace team is assembled to pull off the unlikely heist. Given their range of associates, the brothers track down the one-and-only Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) to help them.
