Johannesburg The labour court in Johannesburg has dismissed with costs the Labour Minister s appeal against a ruling that Johan Crouse should be reinstated as labour registrar. The judgment delivered on Wednesday was critical of the minister s decision to remove Crouse from the position in 2015 for instituting deregistration procedures against the incompliant chemicals union, Ceppwawu. The court found that by moving Crouse to his old position in the department, the minister acted irrationally , while the decision itself was procedurally unfair. The minister s argument in court papers that Crouse had failed to adequately inform her of the decision to act against Ceppwawu also did not hold water. The court could not establish any wrongdoing on the part of Crouse, as existing laws which govern the functions of the labour registrar made no provision for Crouse to inform the minister of specific matters he was dealing with. &quot;I am delighted and a bit sceptical. I don't know what their (labour department's) next move is. I find myself constantly having to look behind my back to see wat they will throw at me,&quot; he said, adding he wasn't certain at this point whether he would be returning to work. @ZintleMahlati @ThetoThakane Politics and Development Hub
