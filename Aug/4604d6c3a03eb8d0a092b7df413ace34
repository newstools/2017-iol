LONDON – Chris Wood scored his first goal for Burnley to rescue a 1-1 Premier League draw on Sunday as Tottenham Hotspur’s Wembley Stadium hoodoo struck again. Spurs looked on course for a first victory since moving to their temporary home while White Hart Lane is being rebuilt when Dele Alli gave them a second-half lead. But Wood slotted home two minutes into injury time to earn Burnley a point that means Tottenham have won just two of their 12 games at the national stadium since it reopened in 2007. Spurs appeared to have done enough to respond to last week’s defeat against Chelsea, but it was far from the free-flowing football their fans have come to expect under Mauricio Pochettino. However, Tottenham were rewarded for a bright start to the second half. Alli converted from Eriksen’s corner in the 49th minute after Ben Mee failed to clear and the England midfielder’s initial effort came back to him off teammate Mousa Dembele. Kane has never scored a Premier League goal in August and his poor form in front of goal continued as he missed another chance, having been sent up by Eriksen. After Burnley sent on record signing Wood for his Premier League debut, Stephen Ward shot over on the half-volley when well placed inside the area. Burnley continued to look dangerous on the break, however, and only some quick-thinking by Hugo Lloris prevented an equaliser after he raced off his line to deny Wood with a sliding tackle. But Wood, who signed from Leeds United, coolly converted from Brady’s last-gasp through ball to earn Burnley a draw and draw boos from portions of the 67 862 crowd. AFP
