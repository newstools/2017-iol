Johannesburg - Fiat Chrysler SA has announced that it will no longer sell Dodge and Chrysler vehicles in South Africa, but it’s not a complete blow for fans of American brands as Jeep is here to stay. The reason for dropping Chrysler and Dodge is that the US parent company has decided it’s no longer worthwhile to continue producing the two brands’ vehicles in right-hand drive configuration. Chrysler and Dodge have already scaled down their presence in South Africa, and in recent years Dodge has only sold the Journey locally while Chrysler’s range consisted only of the 300C and Voyager. FCA has said it will continue to support and service current Chrysler and Dodge vehicles through its franchise dealers. The local division is also set to bolster its Jeep range with the introduction of the all-new Compass in the first quarter of 2018, and the next-generation Wrangler later in the year. Also on the cards for South Africa is the 527kW V8-powered Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. The local division will continue to expand its Italian offerings too. The Fiat range has recently seen the introduction of the Tipo and Panda, while the Alfa Romeo’s Giulia is set to be joined by the Stelvio SUV towards the end of this year. Furthermore, FCA has  promised to expand its local dealer footprint, with new dealerships planned for Durban, Menlyn, Fourways and Sandton. FCA South Africa CEO Robin van Rensburg said: “The future for FCA in South Africa is certainly an interesting one, my management team, indeed my entire staff complement, have their work cut-out for them and I am confident that we will succeed. “FCA’s brands have succeeded in the past, and, will once again, become a force to be reckoned with in the local market.” IOL Motoring
