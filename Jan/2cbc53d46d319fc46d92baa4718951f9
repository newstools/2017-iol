They are unlikely to give clearance because that would cause an outcry in Cameroon where eight players turned down call ups for the finals in Gabon, African soccer sources told Reuters. The Cameroon Football Federation has made no official comment on the issue, while Liverpool are consulting their lawyers before deciding whether to play him. Soccer’s world governing body Fifa told the Merseyside club to make up their own minds on whether Matip could play, saying on Monday it had directed Liverpool to “the applicable provisions” of the regulations. Matip was left out of the squad for Sunday’s 1-1 Premier League draw at Manchester United and last night's FA Cup third-round replay away to fourth-tier Plymouth Argyle because world governing body Fifa had not confirmed he was eligible. West Bromwich Albion took the same precaution with full-back Allan Nyom for Saturday’s 4-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur. However, Ajax Amsterdam used goalkeeper Andre Onana - one of the eight who decided not to play for Cameroon at the tournament - on Sunday in a 3-1 win at PEC Zwolle in the Dutch championship. Cameroonian officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said it would leave it up to Fifa to decide if any action should be taken but Cameroon had “moved on” from the matter. Matip was called up for Afcon 2017 despite having not played since last year’s World Cup. Reuters
