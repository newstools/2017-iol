Burgersfort - Limpopo police achieved a major breakthrough in the fight against illegal mining when two alleged kingpins were arrested by members the police organised crime unit on Friday night, Limpopo police said. The two suspects, aged 40 and 62, where arrested after sterling detective work launched immediately after the initial and subsequent arrests of nine suspects. The duo were from Pretoria and Rustenburg respectively, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said on Saturday. On May 25, a high density operation comprising of officials from the mineral resources department and the South African Police Service (SAPS) was conducted along the R37 between Lebowakgomo and Burgersfort, covering all identified sites in both clusters, Mojapelo said. The operation was led by Limpopo deputy police commissioner responsible for detective services Maj-Gen Bafana Linda. It yielded instant results when suspects were arrested at different sites. Mining machinery, including excavators, TLBs (tractor-loader-backhoe earth moving equipment), and trucks, as well as unprocessed chrome were confiscated. Members of the provincial organised crime unit then launched an intelligence-driven operation in the Mooihoek area near Burgersfort and followed up information that led to the arrest of the two suspects and the confiscation of a Toyota Hilux, laptops, and other materials. The two alleged kingpins were linked to illegal mining activities, including buying and exporting chrome to foreign countries, Mojapelo said. Limpopo police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba commended all police members who were involved in this major success. The suspects would appear in the Lebowakgomo Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges related to the contravention of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Act and the National Environmental Maintenance Act, Mojapelo said.African News Agency
