Istanbul - A blast killed four Turkish police officers in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir on Monday, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported, blaming Kurdish militants.Two officers were also injured in the explosion&nbsp;in the historic Sur district which was the scene of heavy fighting last year between militants linked to the armed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and state security forces, reducing much of the area to rubble.Fighting between the PKK and the state was reignited in 2015 after peace talks broke down, ending a two-year ceasefire. Since then, thousands have been killed.The government says it will not return to negotiations with the armed group, which it deems a terrorist organization. The PKK&nbsp;is demanding more autonomy for the Kurdish minority in Turkey. dpa
