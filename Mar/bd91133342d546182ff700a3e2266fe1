Johannesburg The Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu, who is also an African National Congress (ANC) MP, on Monday distanced herself from claims on social media that she is a candidate for the ruling party's deputy president position. &quot;The Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu has noted with concern posters and flyers circulating on the social media platforms suggesting that she is a candidate to be a deputy president of the ANC in a 'slate' where Mr Mathews Phosa is president and many other suggestions on the social media,&quot; the Department of Human Settlements said in a statement. &quot;The minister would like to put it on record again that she is not a candidate for any slate. She has not expressed any interest in the leadership of the ANC, either president or deputy president. The minister understands and respects the ANC processes.&quot; The department said members of the ANC and all South Africans &quot;are urged to ignore all posters and flyers related to this matter&quot;. In a statement issued by the head of communications Ndivhuwo Mabaya the department said the minister s daily priority is to ensure that the human settlements sector delivers houses to the poorest of the poor as fast as possible.
