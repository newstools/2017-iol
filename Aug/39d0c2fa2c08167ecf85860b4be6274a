Prep and cook 30 mins
Serves 2 Ingredients 100 g brown basmati rice 25 g ginger 1 garlic clove 2 spring onions 1 fresh chilli oil for frying e.g. sunflower ​250 g beef mince ​200 g summer greens 2 tablespoons tamari ½ tablespoon mirin 2 tablespoons kimchi ½ tablespoon sesame seeds 1 lime Method Put a kettle of water on to boil. Rinse the rice in a sieve under cold running water. Place in a saucepan with a pinch of salt. Cover well with boiling water and simmer for 25 mins until tender. Meanwhile, peel and finely grate enough of the ginger so you have approx. 1 tbsp. Peel and finely chop 1 garlic clove. Trim and finely slice 2 spring onions. Deseed and finely slice the chilli. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a frying pan. Fry the beef for 10 mins on a medium heat, turning often, until well coloured. While the beef browns, strip the summer green leaves away from their tough central stalks. Discard the stalks and finely shred the leaves. Wash them well but don’t dry them. Add the garlic and ginger to the beef. Fry for 2 mins. Add the tamari, mirin, spring onions and as much chilli as you fancy. Fry for a further 2 mins. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Leave to rest.Put another saucepan on the heat. Add the greens and cook for 4-5 mins, until wilted and tender. Add a dash more water if needed. When cooked, stir in the kimchi. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt if needed. Drain the rice and serve with the beef and greens. Garnish with the sesame seeds and a wedge of lime. TIP Rather than cook the greens in oil you can keep the leaves wet after washed and rely on the residual water to lightly steam them in a hot saucepan. Kimchi is a punchy fermented condiment from South Korea, not too dissimilar to sauerkraut. It is fresh, crisp and deeply savoury.
