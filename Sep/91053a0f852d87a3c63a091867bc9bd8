London - A pad that can detect if a pregnant woman is at risk of miscarriage or premature birth is being trialled by midwives in the UK. Around one in ten mothers-to-be will suffer from premature rupture of the amniotic membrane, which increases the risk of potentially fatal infections and early birth. Small tears in the membrane can go undetected, or leaking amniotic fluid may be mistaken for urine leaks. The pad, called Amniosense, is worn like a sanitary towel for up to 12 hours at a time. It has a central test strip that changes colour when it comes into contact with amniotic fluid. It is being tested at NHS Frimley Health Foundation Trust. Daily Mail
