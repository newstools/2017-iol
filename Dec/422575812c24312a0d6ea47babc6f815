'Eddie the Eagle' filmmaker Dexter Fletcher has replaced Bryan Singer on the Queen biopic 'Bohemian Rhapsody' after he was sacked by 20th Century Fox. The 51-year-old actor and director has helmed films such as 'Eddie the Eagle' and 'Wild Bill' and is now set to restart production on the Rami Malek-led biopic after Singer, 52, was sacked by 20th Century Fox, Deadline report. READ: Queen confirm biopic The 'X-Men' filmmaker has claimed his services were "terminated" by the studio after he asked for some time off to go back to the US to deal with "pressing health matters concerning one of my parents". In a statement, Singer said: "I wanted nothing more than to be able to finish this project and help honor the legacy of Freddie Mercury and Queen, but Fox would not permit me to do so because I needed to temporarily put my health, and the health of my loved ones, first. "'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a passion project of mine. With fewer than three weeks to shoot remaining, I asked Fox for some time off so I could return to the US to deal with pressing health matters concerning one of my parents. This was a very taxing experience, which ultimately took a serious toll on my own health. Unfortunately, the studio was unwilling to accommodate me and terminated my services. This was not my decision and it was beyond my control." Singer denied speculation his exit was down to "a dispute" with lead star Malek - who will play the band's late frontman Mercury in the motion picture - but admitted they did have "creative differences" on set at times. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' will chart the rock band's story up to their appearance at the Live Aid charity concert in 1985. As well as Malek portraying enigmatic footman Freddie Mercury, Ben Hardy will portray drummer Roger Taylor, Joe Mazzello is in line to star as bassist John Deacon and Gwilym Lee will play lead guitarist Brian May.
