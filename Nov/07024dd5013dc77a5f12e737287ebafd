Rita Ora, 26, has revealed she had her eggs frozen in her early 20s to protect her dream of having children. The 26-year-old singer - who is believed to be dating Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood's son Tyrone Wood - has admitted she made the decision to freeze her eggs over a year ago on her doctor's advice so that if she has to delay having a baby she has a back-up. Rita wants to eventually have a big family and she now feels more confident that this will be possible even if she doesn't get pregnant in the near future. In an interview on Australian TV show 'Sunrise', she said: "Me being 27 soon, I thought about this when I was in my early 20s, about kids. Maybe that is me being a hypochondriac, but I have always wanted a big family and my doctor asked me, 'I think you should freeze your eggs when I was in my early 20s', that is what he said to me ... He has been my family doctor for a long time and he said you are healthy is now and it would be great, why not put them away and then you never have to worry about it again?" The 'Anywhere' singer admitted some people might think her decision was, "crazy", but insisted it felt right to her. She added: "I think it depends on people's beliefs and I'm a big believer in using what we have in making the most of it. I have never said that on TV, and I'm 26 so I know people might say, 'Wow, that's so young'. I just wanted to really be safe. Maybe that is me being crazy."
