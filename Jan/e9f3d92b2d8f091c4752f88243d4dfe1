Cape Town It is well-known that many South Africans drive Toyotas and equally large numbers eat sushi. It is harder to say for sure if many Japanese like a glass of pinotage with their biltong while they are watching, say, a game of rugby. That may be easier to comment on after the 4th Japan Seminar, themed &quot;Proudly South African&quot;, which is scheduled to be held in Johannesburg on January 31. Brand South Africa, the country's official marketing agency, said on Wednesday that it was a partner for this initiative that aimed &quot;to celebrate South Africa's strengths and opportunities for Japanese businesses to grow and invest in the country&quot;. The event at the Sandton Convention Centre will be hosted by the Japan External Trade Organisation, the Embassy of Japan in South Africa and the local branch of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industries. BrandSA said the executive managing director for Japan's Institute for International Trade and Investment, Saburo Yuzawa, would be joined by senior representatives from various organisations, including the Department of Trade and Industry, at the seminar. Among other things, they would look at the competitive strengths of the South African nation brand. &quot;The seminar aims to deepen mutual understanding and strengthen collaborative relations between the businesses and public entities of both nations,&quot; BrandSA said.
