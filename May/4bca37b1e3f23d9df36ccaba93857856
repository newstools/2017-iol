Three days, three African countries, one primal running experience. That is how the Mapungubwe Transfrontier Wildrun has billed the 92 kilometre race.  The 3 day trail running safari experience through the culturally significant and wildlife rich bushveld of the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation area will take place from May 11 to May 13, 2017.  From the ancient Mapungubwe citadel in South Africa, to the rolling savannah of Botswana’s Tuli Block; this journey of discovery takes us across the mighty Limpopo River to the banks of the gigantic Shashe River, through the rural villages of Maramani, past huge Baobabs & along ancient elephant trails etched into stone in Zimbabwe; this is the ultimate safari-on-the-run experience in one of Africa’s most sought-after big-game areas.
