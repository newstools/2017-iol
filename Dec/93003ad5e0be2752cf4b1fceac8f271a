Johannesburg - Two security officers were shot and wounded in apparent cash-in-transit heist on Zuurfontein Road near the Spartan intersection in Kempton Park on Friday, paramedics said. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics found a bakkie lying on the side of the road. The two security guards were found lying 50 metres away in the veld. "Paramedics assessed both men and found that one had sustained a gunshot wound to his arm while the other had sustained numerous gunshot wounds to his legs, leaving him in a serious condition," he said. "Paramedics treated the patients and provided the seriously injured man with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, the men were transported to Arwyp Hospital for further treatment." He said it was understood that an unknown number of men had opened fire on the vehicle, causing it to roll multiple times.  African News Agency
