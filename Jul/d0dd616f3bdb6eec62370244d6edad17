Johannesburg - The Minister of Transport, Joe Maswanganyi, on Tuesday condemn the spate of violent attacks involving
the Meter Taxi Associations as well as the E-hailing operators following the
spiralling attacks and counter attacks involving both of them. “This kind of behaviour
which breeds intimidation and anarchy stands condemned and should not be
allowed in our public transport system and our country in general” said Maswanganyi. Maswanganyi said that these
attacks were not in keeping with the government vision to promote a safe,
reliable, effective, efficient, coordinated, integrated and environmentally
friendly public transport system. “These attacks are also
against the ethos of the society we are seeking to build, a society free of
hate, violence and crime,” said Maswanganyi. Maswanganyi said  he would be meeting the Meter Taxi
Association as well as Uber Management to deal with this debacle. Read also: Metered, e-hailing taxi drivers wage fiery war “As government, we will also
work with all the Ministers in the Security Cluster as well as other relevant
government Departments to have a multi-pronged approach in dealing with this
debacle,” said Maswanganyi. Maswanganyi calls upon
members of the society with any knowledge and information of the perpetrators
of this violence and criminality to report such gruesome incidences to the law
enforcement agencies. Maswanganyi passes his
condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their loved once as a
result of this violence and wishes good health and a speedy recovery to those
recovering in hospital and at home. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
