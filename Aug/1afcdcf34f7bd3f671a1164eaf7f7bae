clear, since July 2016 vehicles have been used to ram into
crowds in a series of militant attacks across Europe, killing
well over 100 people in Nice, Berlin, London and Stockholm. In recent weeks, threatening graffiti against tourists has
appeared in Barcelona, which draws at least 11 million visitors
a year. In one video released under the slogan "tourism kills
neighbourhoods", several hooded individuals stopped a tourist
bus in Barcelona, slashed the tyres and spray-painted the
windscreen. Reuters
