Berlin - Germany has stepped up its campaign against organized
crime by spending 5 million euros (5.7 million dollars) to buy the
so-called Panama Papers, which contain a list of those exploiting
secret offshore tax havens. Berlin officials confirmed on Tuesday that Germany's Federal Criminal
Police Office (BKA) had bought the papers, which were published last
year, as part of its bid to track down on possible German-based tax
fraudsters. The Panama Papers, published by several media groups around the
world, named those who had used Panama-based law firm Mossack
Fonseca, a Central American tax haven. The list of names included politicians, their families and close
associates from around the world. In September 2016, Denmark agreed to pay an anonymous source for
information about hundreds of Danish nationals mentioned in the data
leak. dpa
