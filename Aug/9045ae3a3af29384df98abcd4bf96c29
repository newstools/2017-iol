Some of our local personalities and bloggers have recently showed on their various social media platforms that reading is also one of their favourite pastimes while they are traveling. Here are what some of our personalities shared as their current favourite reads. 1. Basetsana Khumalo and her holiday reads The media mogul shared all the books she's itching to get into. Some of these reads include critically acclaimed Life & Times of Michael K  a 1983 novel by South African-born writer J. M. Coetzee. The novel won the Booker Prize for 1983. The novel is a story of a man named Michael K, who makes an arduous journey from Cape Town to his mother's rural birthplace, during an imaginary civil war during the apartheid era, in the 1970-80s. All packed and ready to enjoy great reads.I'm sure by now you've figured out that I'm a fanatic and  voracious reader. I might not get through all of them but be sure most will be read, I rather pack more than I might get through. I'm tired, I need to regroup, re-energize, re-constitute, rest and spend quality time with #TheTribe! So it's not goodbye....its not that we will not see each other again...will see you on the flip side when we get back to Mzansi. Will connect in a while....girl needs time out. Thank you for the love and I love you right back plus tax, vat, squared, x 100.  Enjoy the rest of Women's Month. See you soon. 💖💕🌹🎀🎀👍 #ChasingSummer #FamilyVacation #Masiphumuleni A post shared by Basetsana Kumalo (@basetsanakumalo) on Aug 15, 2017 at 11:24am PDT Looking forward to finishing my book on the flight home📚 #TheGirlOnTheTrain #JJBxBali 📸 @justshaamguy A post shared by Jade Robertson (@justjadeblog) on Aug 14, 2017 at 3:07am PDT When I travel is usually when I read the most. Started reading Don't settle for Safe by @sarahjakesroberts on the plane yesterday and wow! It's so thought provoking and Sarah is so real. Can't wait to start reading The Sisterhood by @bobbiehouston & Without Rival by @lisabevere . #BooksThatWillChallengeAndChangeYou #LDTravels #LDH #ComingSoon A post shared by LEANNE DLAMINI (@iamleanned) on Aug 15, 2017 at 5:31am PDT
