Cape Town – Steinhoff‘s recent fall from grace has highlighted that fund managers don’t always know best regarding your investments. In the hopes that savvy South African investors will empower themselves, online education provider GetSmarter has launched a new course from the University of Cape Town - the UCT Investment Management online short course. This online short course will help budding investors gain the confidence to take ownership of their own financial wellbeing by making informed, responsible decisions regarding their investment portfolio. The UCT Investment Management course offers a practical guide to the world of financial investments. It's clear that having a background and some investor insight is vital when choosing how to invest. Leaving all your investment decisions to a fund manager is not always the best idea and can be a costly gamble. This online short  course, which runs over 8 weeks, will arm you with an investment management certificate and empowers you to ask the right questions of your fund manager and equips you with a better understanding of the fundamental principles behind investing. The course is presented entirely online, using a people-centric and proactive learning approach, specifically designed for adult learners. Students can expect to receive a high degree of proactive support from GetSmarter’s team of Success Managers, Head Tutors and Tech Support. What the course offers: * Earn a certificate of completion from the University of Cape Town. * The investigative skills needed for accessing offshore financial investments. * An understanding of the fundamental concepts of investing. * The ability to analyse different investment philosophies and constraints. * The ability to lead and estimate the basic return of an equity investment. * The expertise required to select a money market product and outline its characteristics. * The ability to apply the fundamental principles of pooled investing. * The knowledge to distinguish alternative asset classes and their associated financial markets and products.
