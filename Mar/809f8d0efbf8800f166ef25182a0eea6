Cape Town - Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has been placed front and centre of the ongoing Sassa crisis with some 17 million recipients fearful that they may not get their payouts come April 1, when the initial deal with Cash Paymaster Services expires.Following the resignation of her director general over the weekend, and the Treasury distancing itself from the crisis, Dlamini called a press conference on Sunday.During the briefing she sparred with journalists, not exactly covering herself in glory as she placed the blame for the grants payment crisis at the door of South Africa's media houses. &nbsp;IOL
