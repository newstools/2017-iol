Known for his portrayal of James T Kirk, Captain of USS Enterprise in the Star Trek franchise, and American TV series Boston Legal, he recently made headlines as the first in a series of high-profile guests appearing at this year’s London Comic Con.    It seems from Shatner’s first six tweets, the film production is in the Cape Winelands. The first tweet is a picture of a semi-completed mansion, captioned: “Filmed in this half-completed mansion. Construction started then stopped and it’s left unfinished.”    Shatner posted two more pictures – of a pool, and a backyard view of the mansion. The semi-completed mansion has 20 bedrooms and 27 bathrooms.    “Long day of filming today. 11am to 11pm. I’ll stop back on breaks,” he posted on Saturday. The two-time Emmy and Golden Globe award-winning actor also visited Cape Point and Table Mountain. Weekend Argus
