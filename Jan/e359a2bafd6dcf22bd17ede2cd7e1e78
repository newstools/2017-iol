Kitzbuehel, Austria - World motorcycle champion Marc Marquez opted for an alternative method to tackle one of the toughest Alpine ski courses in Europe: charging up it on his MotoGP bike. The 23-year-old Spaniard put snow spikes on his wheels as he rode up Austria's Hahnenkamm mountain in the Kitzbuehel Alps, which skiers normally race down at speeds of up to 110km/h. "It was really difficult to keep the bike under control, he said, "but I'm young and it's good fun to try some crazy things." Marquez managed to reach a high enough speed to perform some entertaining wheelies for the crowd, in a video released on Thursday by Red Bull, who helped put on the stunt.. Marquez follows in the tyre-tracks of Red Bull Racing's Dutch driver Max Verstappen, who drove his Formula One car on the same section of slope in 2016. The Kitzbuehel slope is hosting an Alpine Ski World Cup meet this week which will end on Sunday with the men's slalom.   Reuters  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
