SYDNEY - Former captain Stephen Moore will miss the Wallabies' Rugby Championship Test against South Africa next week to be with his wife who is expecting their third child, team officials said on Friday. The 122-Test hooker will not travel with the squad to Perth this weekend to remain at home in Brisbane awaiting the birth. Waratahs hooker Tolu Latu will join the squad after overcoming a neck injury that ruled him out of the opening two Bledisloe Cup Tests against New Zealand. Moore will re-join the squad following the match against South Africa with the hooker available for selection for the Test with Argentina in Canberra on September 16. The squad otherwise remains unchanged, with the Wallabies currently third on the Rugby Championship table after just one bonus point in the opening two rounds. South Africa top the standings following two convincing wins against Argentina. At home the Wallabies have won 24 of the 37 Tests against South Africa including the last three Test matches.
