Blac Chyna's new man says Rob Kardashian is a "good guy". Rob recently accused his former fianc√©e Chyna of cheating on him with rapper Ferrari True, and although Rob took to Instagram to share pictures of Chyna and the other man together, Ferrari says he has no bad feelings towards the sock entrepreneur.

SMILEüòÅ @blacchyna A post shared by Only 1 Ferrari (@ferraritru3) on Jul 6, 2017 at 8:52am PDT Earlier this week, Rob posted explicit pictures of Chyna on Instagram and accused his former fianc√©e of cheating on him, taking drugs and leaving him after he paid for her to undergo weight loss surgery. The 30-year-old reality star claimed Chyna had sent him a picture of herself without underwear on, shortly before she slept with Ferrari. In a now-deleted post, he captioned the graphic image: "This is from Chyna yesterday to me. I never been so disrespected in my life. I just bought her 250K of jewelry yesterday. This woman is so disrespectful and I don't care (sic)." The reclusive sock designer also shared a video of 29-year-old Chyna locking lips with Ferrari.

In response to Rob's social media onslaught, Chyna took to Snapchat and accused her former partner of hitting her. She wrote: "Rob u did all this but u beat me up and try act it never happen!!!!! "U put hand on me I swear on god!!!! On my kids but I'm supposed to be quiet because you're a Kardashian. The light will come to the light.(sic)"
