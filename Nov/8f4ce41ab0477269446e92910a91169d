Stuttgart - Mercedes-Benz has given us yet another preview of its all-new CLS sedan ahead of its global unveiling at the LA Auto Show this Wednesday, and the video is so revealing that it leaves very little to the imagination.   Last week the company released a darkened teaser image of the front end and one of the central dashboard. This showed us that the so-called coupe-sedanâ€™s cabin will be largely borrowed from its E-Class cousin, with the 62cm dual screen instrument cluster and infotainment combo taking centre stage, but some of the details, such as the quad central air vents, have been jazzed up, as you'll see below. As before, the Mercedes CLS will share its platform with the E-Class, and inherit its gadgets and gizmos, while possibly adding a few more, and its engines will be lifted from the aforementioned as well as the latest S-Class sedan.
