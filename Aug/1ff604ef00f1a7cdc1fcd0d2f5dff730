Kendrick is also up for Best Hip Hop Video, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Choreography for the video for his hit single 'Humble'. Katy's single 'Chained To The Rhythm' is nominated for Best Pop Video, Best Direction and Best Visual Effects, whilst her track 'Bon Appetite' is up for Best Art Direction. The MTV VMAs has hit the headlines for various reasons over the years, such as in 1984 when Madonna sang 'Like a Virgin' while rolling around the stage in a white wedding dress, and in 2003 she kissed Britney Spears on stage. Britney also shocked in 2001 when she performed 'I'm a Slave 4 U' with a giant yellow python draped across her shoulders, and there was another controversial smooch in 1994 when Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley shared an awkward kiss on stage just three months after tying the knot.
