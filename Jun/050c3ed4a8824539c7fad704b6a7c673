London - The leader of the local council which owns Grenfell
Tower in west London, where at least 80 people died in a huge fire,
and the head of the housing trust managing the building stepped down
on Friday as the political fallout from the disaster continued to
widen. Conservative Nick Paget-Brown, the leader of the Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea council, resigned after criticism of his
response to the fire, most recently by the government earlier Friday,
the BBC and other media reported. The Kensington and Chelsea Tenants' Management Organization, which
managed the social housing block for the council, said its management
board had agreed that RobertÂ Black "should step aside from his role
as chief executive of KCTMO in order that he can concentrate on
assisting with the investigation and inquiry." dpa
