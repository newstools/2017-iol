Cape Town - The City's Traffic Services believe they have uncovered a vehicle roadworthy scam after they pulled over a delapidated rubble truck - which had been certified roadworthy just hours before. Two officers from the Road Haulage Unit stopped and inspected the heavily laden vehicle last Thursday, on its way to a dumping site in Sacks Circle, Bellville South, and found a dozen major faults on it. The tyres were smooth, the lights were broken, the shocks were defective and the brakes were worn out - yet the driver seemed unaware of any defects on his truck. Mayoral committee member for safety, security and social services JP Smith said the officers were taken aback when the driver presented a roadworthy certificate that had been issued just hours before at a private testing facility. “The truck was immediately suspended from operating on a public road," he said, "and the matter reported to the Inspectorate at the Western Cape department of transport for further investigation and feedback including opening a criminal charge against the company or examiner who issued the roadworthy certificate.” In other news on our roads, the Western Cape Provincial Traffic Services reported one death over the weekend on the N1 in Worcester, while provincial traffic officers arrested 23 motorists for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol on 12 and 13 May. Six were arrested in Mossel Bay, four in George, three in Swellendam, three in Caledon, two in Knysna, one in Brackenfell, one in Beaufort West, one in Vredendal, one in Oudtshoorn and one in Worcester.
