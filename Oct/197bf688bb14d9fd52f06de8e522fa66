Oxford, England - As far as pocket rocket classics go, few are remembered as fondly as Mini’s 1275 GT of 1969, and now the British brand wants to bring those good vibes back, or at least capitalise on them, with a modern equivalent called the 1499 GT. As with the 1275, the new GT’s 1499 badging refers to its cubic capacity, but it also signifies the limited production run of just 1499 units. Sadly the new creation is for the UK market only. Although our initial assumption was that it would share its heart with the 100kW Mini Cooper, or even get a power hike, the 1499 is in fact powered by a detuned version of that 1.5-litre, three-cylinder turbopetrol engine, producing just 75kW. But doesn’t that match the current Mini One, you might ask? Indeed it does, and according to reports the latter’s 1.2-litre turbopetrol will soon be replaced by the detuned 1.5 that’s being ushered in by the 1499 GT. It’s still good for a 10.1 second 0-60mph (96km/h) sprint and in all fairness the original 1275 was more about nippy agility on a budget than outright speed. On that note, the 1499 is fitted with a sports suspension package. The new GT also gains some tasty kit in the form of 17-inch Track Spoke black alloys, JCW bumpers, side skirts, a split-level spoiler, JCW steering wheel and sports seats in Dinamica and leather, as well as Piano Black and Carbon Black interior trimmings. Only two exterior colours are offered, Pepper White and Midnight Black, both featuring contrasting side stripes. IOL Motoring
