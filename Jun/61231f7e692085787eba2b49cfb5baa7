Following a series of bungles over the past few weeks, Durban-based starlet Babes Wodumo finally got her act together and signed with a new PR team. Wodumo, real name Bongekile Simelane, has officially signed with African Star Communications, the company announced on Monday. The starlet's boss and reported beau, Mampintsha, had earlier said the company was in discussions with a reputable PR firm to takeover the public relations management of artists in the stable. Mampintsha said they could not yet reveal the name of the PR firm as they were yet to sign a formal contract and were still in discussions. Wodumo is best known for her multi-nominated hit single ‘Wololo'. African Star in a statement confirmed the move and expressed excitement at signing the dancing sensation. “We are really excited to be working with Babes, as we have been in talks for quite some time now. We look forward to a fruitful relationship & hope to continue growing the Babes Wodumo brand” said head publicist at African Star Justine Abrahams. The Wololo hitmaker recently caused a stir when it was revealed that she and Mampintsha were meant to travel to the US this week but failed to apply for their travel visa on time. Wodumo, Nasty C and Super Mega AKA were all nominated in the Best International Act: Africa category. A source at the American Embassy's offices in Durban, who cannot be named as they were not permitted to speak to the media, said the duo only rocked up at the embassy a few days before the trip to apply for the travel visa.
