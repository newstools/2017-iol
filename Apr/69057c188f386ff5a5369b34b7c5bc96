  Perth - The driver of this Holden Commodore in Western Australia hopefully learned some valuable lessons about the dangers of weaving through traffic after this hectic accident that saw the rear-wheel drive sedan spin in circles and bash into the railings numerous times, causing many of the car’s body parts fly off. According to the person driving the truck from which the video was taken: "witnesses said he was weaving in and out of traffic for a while.. he was undertaking everyone and then when he came to overtake me, he got sideways and smashed into my front steerer and bullbar.” The video was posted onto YouTube channel Dash Cam Owners Australia and will hopefully serve as a warning to other reckless drivers to be careful out there.
