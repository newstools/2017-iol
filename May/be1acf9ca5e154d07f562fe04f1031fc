Johannesburg - Former Generations star Mandla Hlatshwayo’s final moments on air, a day before his death, have been captured in a series of videos posted by the DJ on his Facebook page.  Hlatshwayo was gunned down during a botched robbery on Sunday night in Soweto.  He was known for his role on Generations, playing Siphiwe Phosa as well being a DJ on Jozi FM. In a series of live videos posted on May 13, Hlatshwayo is seen in high spirits while hosting his Weekend Special radio show. In one video, the radio DJ is seen dancing to house music while presenting his show. In another video, he is seen happily jamming to music being played by another DJ.   These captured moments would be one of the DJ’s final on-air moments as a day later, Hlatshwayo and his friend Oupa "Chum Chum" Duma were gunned down at the Meli Lounge in Soweto. Jozi FM CEO Mpho Mhlongo took to social media on Monday morning to confirm the tragic news. “It is with sadness that I inform you of the passing of our beloved brother, friend and colleague, Mandla Hlatshwayo. He was gunned down last night at Meli pub in Pimville. He will be sorely missed. May his humble soul Rest in Peace!” Police spokesperson Captain Nomvula Mbense also confirmed the deaths, saying four armed men stormed a pub in Pimville between 10pm and 11pm and tried to rob everyone inside. “Two victims were shot during the robbery and died on the scene. At this stage it’s not clear what was stolen from the scene." “A manhunt is underway for the four men and a case of premeditated murder and armed robbery has been opened – investigations are continuing,” she said.  khanyisile.ngcobo@inl.co.za  IOL
