PARIS – Edinson Cavani’s superb scoring form continued when the Uruguay striker netted a double as Ligue 1 leaders Paris St Germain snatched an easy 5-0 win at Angers on Saturday. With his 12th and 13th goals of the season, Cavani struck each side of the interval, as did France striker Kylian Mbappe, while Julian Draxler also found the back of the net to put PSG on 32 points from 12 games. They lead champions Monaco, who take on En Avant Guingamp later on Saturday, by seven points. Even without the suspended Neymar, PSG were a cut above Angers and they made sure they would not be troubled by taking a very fast start. Mbappe drew first blood with a low, crossed shot after being set up by Dani Alves to give the visitors an early lead. Draxler made it 2-0 nine minutes later, squeezing the ball past Mathieu Michel after collecting a perfect through ball from Alves. Cavani put the result beyond doubt on the half hour, firing past Michel from Mbappe’s clever back-heel in the area for his 100th goal in 144 Ligue 1 games. The Uruguayan scored again on the hour with a powerful shot from just inside the box following a defence-splitting pass by Javier Pastore, who was in the starting eleven for the first time in two-and-a-half months. Mbappe rubbed salt in the hosts’ wounds with a clinical finish after a pass from Lucas in the 84th. Reuters
