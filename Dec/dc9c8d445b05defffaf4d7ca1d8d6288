Traceleen Booys was naked, she had been raped and her attacker had slit her throat.  According to neighbours, Traceleen had been with her boyfriend at a shebeen in Lahey Street, the street where her body was found. But the family has no knowledge of a boyfriend. Her stepfather, David Bangiso, 27, who raised her from the age of eight,  said she was never one to stay out late.   “I last saw her at home on Saturday afternoon. She never went out late, so it was strange that she was not home. I always spoke to her of the dangers of being out late and we had an understanding about her safety,” he says. “We did not know of a 
boyfriend either. “A Rasta we know had stumbled upon her body and came to tell us. It was an horrific scene.” David described the nightmare scene at the incomplete house, where police were already at work. “She was lying there naked with her throat slit,” he says.  “Her mother, Delecia Booys, 38, is not dealing well with this at all. All she wants is her child back and for  this nightmare to be over. We really want this to be just a dream.” The man who has been identified as her boyfriend, is nowhere to be found. David says they are traumatised and don’t know how to deal with the tragedy. “I don’t understand why she was so brutally taken away from us. Her mother is in a state because they were very close. I don’t know how we are going to get over this loss,” he says sadly. Police spokesperson, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana, confirms an investigation is under way.   “Cases of murder and rape have been opened for investigation after a body of 16-year-old female was found in Lahey Street, Wallacedene, Kraaifontein,” she says, adding there have been no arrests.  “We appeal to anyone with more information who can assist with the investigation to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111.”  Daily Voice
