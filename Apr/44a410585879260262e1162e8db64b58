London - Airline cabin crew helped deliver a premature baby thousands of feet above the Earth. Turkish Airlines crew jumped into action when an expectant mother, Nafi Diaby, began experiencing labour pains on a flight between Conakry and Ouagadougou, in Burkina Faso. Her daughter Kadiju was born prematurely at 28 weeks but the airline said both mother and baby were healthy after they were taken to hospital upon landing on Friday. A Turkish Airlines statement said: "After the smooth landing of Boeing B737-900 type aircraft to the Ouagadougou airport, the mother Nafi Diaby and her newborn baby girl were taken to the hospital in order to be kept under observation for a while.
