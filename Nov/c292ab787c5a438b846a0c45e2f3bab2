The the theme for this year's Cintron Pink Polo event is "Polo Chic", which is a celebration of the elegant fashion and sense of style that accompanies the sport. Here are a few style ideas to draw inspiration from: SUIT UP Bold: Make a statement by wearing pink head to toe. Step out in a bold a daring shade of pink like fuchsia or magenta to make an unforgettable entrance. Subtle: For a sophisticatedly subtle and laid back look, opt for a more subdued pinky hue in blush, salmon or rose in a softer fabric. ACCESSORIZE Neckerchief: A neckerchief can add a chic touch to your look. Patterned or plain, wear it with your shirt collar unbuttoned for a more relaxed feel especially when worn with a crisp white or pastel coloured shirt and formal pants. Pocket square: Suit pocket accessories, like flower pins and pocket broaches, are seasonal but the a pocket square will always be a sophisticated addition to any look. Keeping in line with the pink theme choose a printed fabric. Florals work well but look out for graphic or animal prints as well.
