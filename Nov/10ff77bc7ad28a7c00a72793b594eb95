Now Paramount Players are hoping to fast track the remake which will see Henson playing a female sports agent who has been constantly out boxed by her male colleagues.

This isn't the first time Hollywood has re-worked a film with a female focus. Last year, the cult classic 'Ghostbusters' was remade with a full female team - starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones - but unlike the original, the film was heavily criticised and disappointed at the box office. Next year, there will be another female-orientated remake of some sorts with 'Ocean's Eight' - a new take on the George Clooney and Brad Pitt led 'Ocean's Eleven' franchise. 'Ocean's Eight' has a star-studded cast, including Anne Hathaway, Sandra Bullock, Rihanna and Hailey Baldwin. The film will see Matt Damon reprise his role as Linus Caldwell from the 'Ocean's' franchise too.
