Armie Hammer and Luca Guadagnino both confirmed the actor's testicles had to be digitally removed in 'Call Me By Your Name'. The 31-year-old actor plays the role of Oliver in the coming-of-age drama based on the novel of the same name by Andr√© Aciman, alongside Timothee Chalament as teenager Elio. Hammer admitted his "balls" had to be erased from one scene due to the "short shorts" he was wearing. While appearing on Andy Cohen's Sirius XM show, Hammer was asked by the 'Real Housewives' creator "were you balls hanging out?" when questioning him about his short shorts. Hammer replied: "Yup! There was a few times where they had to go back and digitally remove my balls from the movie. "They were short shorts - what are you gonna do? Oh my mom is gonna love listening to this." Cohen then proceeded to say "Armie Hammer has big balls is what you're saying?" before filmmaker Luca Guadagnino interrupted and said: "No, no, I'm not just saying it. We had to remove them." 'Call Me By Your Name' - which was helmed by Guadagnino - follows the story of a young Italian man named Elio who meets Oliver after he visits the country to stay at his parents' villa. The pair then develop a passionate relationship, as they bond over their shared Jewish heritage and their sexuality. Hammer recently revealed he had such a great time working on the love story, he'd be open to "anything" Guadagnino wanted to do in the future. Asked about the filmmaker's hints about a second movie, he said: "You never know with Luca. Sometimes he's joking sometimes I think he's not. People always say, 'You left a small part of the book out'. "Well yeah, it might be a small part of the book in terms of overall page count, but it spans 20-30 years. Luca is joking about coming back to it but my answer to that is, I'll do anything Luca wants." Watch the 'Call Me By Your Name' trailer below:
