When game creator Niantic announced their new video series called Pokemon Go Travel, fans across the world went wild with excitement.

Trainers from different parts of the world, including the United States, Austria, Netherlands and Brazil travelled to Japan this week to host the  first-ever Global Catch Challenge. The 7 day event started today, November 20. The creators enticed the travel element on their website. They urged players to join them as they "discover new places, meet new people, and work together in an attempt to catch 3 billion Pokémon in just 7 days." Players, who want to take join in the game, will get to play alongside seasoned trainers, including IHasCupquake, Coisa de Nerd, and Rachel Quirico. These trainers will learn more about Japanese culture and sight see while  in Japan. They will share their experiences with other players through social media. Besides the travel element, players can unlock rewards that includes prizes in three categories, namely Bronze, Silver and Gold.
