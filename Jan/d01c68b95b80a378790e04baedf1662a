Halle, Berlin - A neighbour-versus-neighbour dispute in&nbsp;Germany got out of hand, with one man biting another man's fingers and losing four of his teeth in the process.In a fit of rage, a 61-year-old reached out and choked a 54-year-old. The latter responded by chomping at his aggressor's fingers - but wound up knocking four his own teeth out as he bit down.Police said that it is unclear what prompted the fight in the cellar of an apartment building in Halle, eastern Germany, on Sunday.
