Ashley Naicker, a senior clerk in Ekurhuleni’s Springs office, allegedly faked being hijacked in October last year, and had his Volvo V40 T3 burnt to claim money from Hollard Insurance, according to the SAPS. He was arrested on Friday in his office after police thwarted his elaborate plot. “This guy got two of his colleagues he is working with at the Ekurhuleni metro, telling them they must hijack him and take the vehicle to an open veld between Brakpan and Tsakane - next to Heidelberg Road - where they burnt the car,” said police spokesperson Captain Johannes Ramphora. “The value of that car was just over R400 000. He couldn’t cope with his monthly instalments. He tried to do these things so the insurance company - Hollard - could settle 
the car and he could buy another.” According to Ramphora, Naicker was paid a portion of the R400 000 claim and also received roughly R18 000 “as change”. His accounts have been frozen and police will seek to recover the money. Ramphora said police worked with Crime Intelligence and the insurance company to investigate the alleged fake hijacking. “Nothing other than the car was taken from Mr Naicker, not even his cellphone or wallet - no valuables whatsoever. This is what got the police to be very suspicious and involve Crime Intelligence,” he said. “We tracked down Naicker’s two colleagues, who sang beautifully, like angels,” Ramphora joked. “We have turned them (the colleagues) into State witnesses because they were very co-operative. We have not charged them. Only the court can decide what to do with them.” Naicker appeared in the Springs Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges of fraud and perjury, and was granted R3000 bail. His next appearance will be on July 18. Pretoria News  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
