The three-day line-up of some of the best acoustic acts will be on show from September 28 to October 1, at White Mountain Lodge, in the beautiful scenery of the foothills of the Giant's Castle Nature Reserve. It's only 185km from Durban and just 25km off the N3, on tarred roads. Known for its intimate and relaxed atmosphere, this year includes the likes of Luke Lovemore (from M-Net’s The Voice SA), Crimson House, Jenny & The Jameses, The Sextons, Black Whiskey, The Sweet Resistance, Jerry & The Bandits, Michael Canfield and Freddy Lalendle, to name a few.  The Sweet Resistance, a chart-topping alternative pop rock band from Cape Town, fronted by Natasha Meister, will be there, and, also from Cape Town, Crimson House will bring their gypsy jungle music. Known for his distinctive, raspy voice and energetic live performances, Freddy Lalendle and his band will wow audiences. There is a wide variety of food and drink outlets, colourful arts and crafts plus loads of outdoor activities for the whole family, including a 100m zip line and fun stuff like scavenger hunts for the kids. Adding another dimension are the lodge's fishable dam, swimming pool and charming old pub (with satellite TV and late-night live music). Festival-goers can also book into a stylish on-site “tent hotel”, offering a relaxing, hassle-free camping experience with all the comforts of home. Tented accommodation sleeping two is available at  R1100 a night for two nights and R1000 a night for three nights. Tickets cost R600 at Computicket and include camping for the entire festival. Tickets for children aged 4-11 cost R185. Children under four free. Visit www.c-weed.com/wmf or call 031 563 0824. Independent on Saturday
