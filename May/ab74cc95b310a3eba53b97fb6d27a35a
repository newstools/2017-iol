Former World No 1 golfer Tiger Woods was arrested on Monday for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol in Jupiter, Florida in the United States. Woods, who has plummeted down the rankings over the last few years due to a continuous state of injury, was reportedly booked in at 7.18am Eastern US Time on Monday. The WPBF TV station in West Palm Beach, Florida reported that according to jail records from the Palm Beach County Jail, Woods was released on his own recognisance at 10.50am.   The Daily Mail reported that Woods faces a charge of driving with a blood alcohol level above Floridaâ€™s legal limit of .08. The 41-year-old, one of the modern-day greats of golf with 14 majors to his name, has battled to regain his former glory following his divorce to Elin Nordegren in 2010. He won his last major at the 2008 US Open, and has had a number of back and knee surgeries since. Woods has gone from being ranked No 1 in the world in early 2014 to his current No 876.
