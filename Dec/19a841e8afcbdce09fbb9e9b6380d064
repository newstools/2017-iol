Johannesburg - Newly-elected president of the African National Congress (ANC) Cyril Ramaphosa, on Tuesday went shopping with the party's new treasurer-general Paul Mashatile during a walkabout among the small businesses plying their trade outside the Nasrec Expo Centre where the party is holding its 54th national conference. Letting off steam following a bruising election for the party's top job against Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a relaxed Ramaphosa casually strolled around the stalls selling ANC merchandise, while chatting to the hawkers and journalists, with a not very heavy security detail in attendance.

At one stall, Ramaphosa stopped to buy ANC T-shirts, costing R300 each, for himself and Mashatile, using R200 notes, but jokingly remarking that the items were "expensive".  Ramaphosa also stopped by another stall to buy music CDs of anti-apartheid struggle songs and a black dashiki shirt with an ANC logo. When asked if he would "fit it" to make sure that the t-shirt was the right size, Ramaphosa said he knew his size and hadn't gained or lost any weight as a result of the conference. Ramaphosa, was also set to make a few remarks to the assembled media after his walkabout, though he is still to make his first official address to the conference as ANC president.  African News Agency/ANA
