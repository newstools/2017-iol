Which means MAN Automotive SA must be very confident indeed that the second generation of its Lion's Explorer bus bodywork – built at the MAN Bus & Coach assembly plant in Olifantsfontein – is a winner, to showcase it at the annual conference of the Southern African Bus Operators Association, on this week at the CSIR Convention Centre in Brummeria. It’s a completely new body, says managing director Markus Geyer, with modern European styling and flowing, fuel-efficient aerodynamic lines, new LED daytime running lights and a completely new rear dome incorporating a distinctive tail-light layout, allied to the robust construction and specific features needed for arduous African operating conditions. The new generation of Lion’s Explorer are clearly integrated into the family of MAN Lion's buses available around the world, points out head of sales Philip Khalil-Zackey, but they are also the only locally made bus bodies for which the builder supplies its own chassis, providing a total bus solution.
