It’s called the Mayfair Edition One of One, and it’s finished in a dark-bronze metallic paint mixed specially for this car, with embossed sill plates that read: “Special Commission – Mayfair Edition One of One”. But the really special stuff is inside – most noticeably the first ever copper dashboard on a Dawn, in place of the usual wood veneer.There’s more copper trim on the speakers, and on the white leather seats, while a lot of the special interior elements were inspired by the delicate brass and bronze components used in super-expensive watch and clock mechanisms. The staff at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars London in Berkeley Square – the group’s flagship branch since 1932 – designed the car, and then took their ideas to the Bespoke division at Rolls-Royce headquarters in Goodwood, whose design studio turned their sketches into the car you see here. The one and only Mayfair Edition is for sale at Berkeley Square; as with so many things at this level of exclusivity, if you have to ask the price, you can't afford it.
