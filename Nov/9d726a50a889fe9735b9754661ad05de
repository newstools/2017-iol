 Multi-platinum alt-rock icons Incubus are coming to tour South Africa for the first time in February 2018. The Californian rockers released their eighth album this year, aptly named 8, and are celebrating the 20th anniversary of their first major label album S.C.I.E.N.C.E with a world tour. The South African leg of the tour will kick off in Pretoria on February 24, before they hit Cape Town on February 28 and will include support from South Africa’s biggest rock legacy acts. Fans will be taken on a musical journey of their vast career, spanning over 20 years of hits and crowd favourites. Since their formation in 1991, the band continues to evolve with every album launched, growing their cult following and impressive award collection over the decades. With worldwide album sales exceeding 23 million, numerous #1 hits on the Billboard chart, including “Drive”, “Megalomaniac”, “Anna-Molly”, and “Love Hurts” they have graced the stages of festivals around the globe and toured with the likes of Linkin Park, OutKast, Queens of the Stone Age and many more. “As a band, we’re collectively interested in challenging ourselves and hopefully finding new, innovative ways of writing music,” says lead vocalist Brandon Boyd. “That ethos has kept things interesting for us.” At the same time, fans can look forward to a sense of nostalgia when listening to select songs from their latest album, as Incubus has returned to their heavier rock roots.
