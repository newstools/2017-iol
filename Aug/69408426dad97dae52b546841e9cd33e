Kabul - At least 25 people were killed when fighters from the
Islamic State extremist group attacked a Shiite mosque in Kabul, an
official confirmed on Friday. More than 40 were injured, including women and children, Mohammad
Ismail Kawoosi, a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told
dpa. The number of casualties may rise, since the ministry has not yet
received reports from all health centres in Kabul, Kawoosi added. The insurgents had stormed a Shiite mosque in Kabul during Friday
prayer, when the mosque was full. The attack and ensuing clearing operation ended after more than five
hours with the death of two attackers, Kabul police spokesman Basir
Mujahid told dpa. According to Mujahid, the pair started the attack with a suicide
blast at the gate of the Imam Zaman Shiite mosque in Khair Khana area
of central Kabul city. "The second attacker was gunned down by Afghan security forces,"
Mujahid added. Two large explosions were reported from the attack scene, the first 
from the suicide blast and the second for bringing a wall during the
rescue operation conducted by Afghan security forces, Mujahid said. The Islamic State extremist group has claimed responsibility for the
explosions, saying that two of its members carried out the attack,
according to the Amaq agency, with which the group is affiliated. In the beginning of August, at least 50 people were killed and 80
injured when insurgents attacked a Shiite mosque in the capital city
of Afghanistan's western Herat province. The last attack on a Shiite mosque in Kabul, in June, left at least
six dead. Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for both attacks. DPA
