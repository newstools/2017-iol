The Rotary Blue Train Park in Cape Town just hosted their inaugural Kids Dream Fest and it was a roaring success, writes Marchelle Abrahams. Halloween doesn't feature high on our local calendar. In fact, it doesn't feature at all. For some kids, it's a fun excuse to dress up in their favourite scary costume and clown around with their neighbourhood friends. I must admit that I'm not a fan of the popular American holiday, but time and time again my son keeps asking why he doesn't get a chance to go trick or treating. A friend of mine called it the slow Americanisation of South African children. So when I mentioned the Kids Dream Fest, he jumped at the chance to attend, and begrudgingly I offered to get him a costume. The Rotary Blue Train Park in Mouille Point hosted their inaugural Kids Dream Fest on Oct 28, and it promised to be a night to remember - and indeed it was.  #halloweentrain #zombies #KidsDreamFest A post shared by The Sunroom (@thesunroomza) on Oct 30, 2017 at 12:46pm PDT  The highlight of the festival was the Halloween Train which saw the Atlantic Seaboard transformed into an experience that aimed to excite and scare.

Would I do it again? Probably not. Did the kids enjoy it? You betcha. And that's all that matters.
