Kempton Park - Sars Customs officials intercepted two bags with 10 rhino horns weighing 24.96kg estimated at R4.99-million at OR Tambo International Airport on Monday. The discovery was made when Customs officials followed up on a suspicious bag which led to a second bag that was offloaded from the cargo hold of the plane bound for Turkey. The contents were scanned and on inspection found to be 4 full rhino horns in the one bag and 6 in the other. Two passengers and their bags were handed over to the South African Police Service for further investigation. Sars wishes to thank Customs staff for their focus, discipline and hard work. We are very proud of the dedicated commitment of SARS Customs staff in preventing illicit drugs and other goods from entering or leaving our country.  Sars will continue to work with all stakeholders at our Ports of Entry, including law enforcement agencies to protect the country and its citizens by disrupting organised crime and reducing illicit trade activities.
