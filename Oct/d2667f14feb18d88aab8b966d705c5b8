Protea Hotel Fire and Ice has given some of their rooms a revamp. Tucked away on the foothills of Table Mountain next to the iconic Bo-Kaap neighbourhood, the hotel is known as a sophisticated haven reflecting the local chic and cutting-edge attitude that gives the suburb of Tamboerskloof its charm. In line with staying ahead of the trend, the hotel is getting a fresh look in all its bedrooms that’s bound to appeal to visitors from around the world. Danny Bryer, the Director of Sales, Marketing and Revenue Management for Protea Hotels by Marriott, said Protea Hotels Fire & Ice! Cape Town has consistently wowed visitors with its cool, yet practical, interior, from comfortable suites to the striking bar and foyer.  "Now the rooms will boast an even closer reflection of CapeTown’s vibrant city centre lifestyle and its charming Bo-Kaap heritage, with their splashes of colour and images of the neighbouring Bo-Kaap area that feature in the rooms. "The Bo-Kaap is a colourful, spicy neighbourhood that’s deeply linked to the city’s heritage and culture, with friendly locals who are marvelous storytellers; curators of Cape Town’s history," he said. Since the refurbishment affects the bedrooms only, there will be no impact on guests, who can continue to enjoy a great stay at this pioneering hotel. Bryer said of the latest, fresh treatment: “This wonderful space has long been a trailblazer among hotels in the heart of the city, an accessible environment with all of the facilities our guests could require. We know that in an urban environment it’s essential to reflect the energy and pace of the city in our designs, and this is what the bedroom refurbishment does. We know that our loyal guests and first-time visitors will love the new-look bedrooms.
