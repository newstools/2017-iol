Marriott International announced this week that they will further expand plans in Africa with seven new hotel signings. 
They announced their plans at the Africa Hotel Investment Forum in Kigali, Rwanda. 
 
The company is targeting over 200 hotels with 37,000 rooms open or in the pipeline by 2022, equating to around $8.5 billion of capital investment by its real estate partners, reinforcing its continued commitment to expansion in Africa and solidifying its leadership on the continent.
 
The investment is expected to generate substantial economic activity and around 50,000 direct and indirect jobs once the hotels open.
 
President and Managing Director, Middle East and Africa, Marriott International, Alex Kyriakidi, said the company has always believed in the potential of Africa and the opportunities the continent has to offer. 
 
“With economic growth, a rising middle class and rapid urbanisation, the demand for travel and high quality lodging is growing, providing us with a significant opportunity to enhance our footprint and play our part in supporting many emerging markets across the continent,” he said.
 
Marriott International hotels has a footprint in 20 African countries, including Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia. The company is expected to foray into new markets including Benin, Botswana, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal and has signed 1300 new rooms marking the debut of Marriott International into Côte D’Ivoire while strengthening its presence in existing markets including Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria.
