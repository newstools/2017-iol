Michael Stanley is the writing partnership of Michael Sears and Stanley Trollip. Their detective novels are set in Botswana. Detective Kubu investigates complex murders, justifying his nickname by his size and tenacity (Kubu is Setswana for hippopotamus). A Bushman's body is found and police suspect foul play. Pathologist Ian MacGregor confirms the cause of death as a broken neck, but he is puzzled by the man’s physiology - he’s very old but his internal organs are remarkably young. When the corpse is stolen, the case takes on a new dimension. Price: R130, www.loot.co.za
