This came after a 21-year-old man was arrested in Cape Town on a charge of public violence. He cannot be named before his court appearance, police spokesperson André Traut said. The open letter by over 60 concerned staff and academics pleaded with Nhlapo to demilitarise campuses, to allow for the immediate entry of “independent peace” mediators, to convene an urgent university assembly and to implement restorative justice. On Monday, CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said private security would remain on campus for as long as the violence against the majority of diligent CPUT staff and students continued. “A mass meeting of the sort
the protesting students are agitating for would in the current volatile climate be a serious security threat, and university management feels it would be irresponsible to host one, considering the chaotic and violent end to the previous two,” she said. CPUT student Neo Mongale said there was much fear among students because of the campus's “militarisation”. “The arrest was shocking. He was on his way to possibly meet with the HoD (head of department), and police arrested him." Meanwhile, stun grenades were fired by police to disperse protesting students.
