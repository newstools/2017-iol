Ivancna Gorica, Slovenia - For those who don’t understand the music that a free-revving superbike makes, be it a twin, a triple or a four, no explanation is possible. For those who do, no explanation is necessary. Here then, to get you revved up for the weekend, is Igor Akrapovic’s tribute to the machines he makes pipes for, and the riders who love them.   Because, once you’ve been there, there is nothing to match the intensity of riding a superbike the way it was made to be ridden - the wall of sound, the vibration, the sudden forces on your body and the way time slows as the horizon first tilts, then bends towards you. Amp up the volume and enjoy. IOL Motoring
