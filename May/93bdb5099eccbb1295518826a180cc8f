Johannesburg â€“ A matric pupil was raped Tuesday morning on her way to school.  Allegations are that the 17-year-old was dragged by an unknown man near Rifle Range road in the south of Johannesburg around 6am.  Police said immediately after the rape, the pupil rushed to school and informed her teachers about the incident.  The teachers quickly contacted the police at the nearby Booysens Police Station who then responded as soon as the complaint was received.  Her family was also contacted and rushed to the police station to be with her.  Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela confirmed that a case or rape was opened but that no one had been arrested yet. Makhubela said they were still investigating the matter.  He also confirmed that the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offence Unit (FCS) was contacted and that the docket has been handed over to them.
