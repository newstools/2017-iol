Those who missed S'fiso Ncwane's funeral which took place on December 10 can now watch the entire ceremony on DVD for only R10. The homemade DVDs are reportedly being sold in the streets of Durban. Some reports claim that the DVD’s cover features the images of Babes Wodumo, Mampitsha and some of artists who performed at Ncwane’s funeral. According to Ncwane Communications spokesperson, Asanda Mpais, the family is "disappointed" and is requesting people to “show respect by not buying the DVD”. “It is painful and disappointing that some people would try to make money in the form of a difficult experience the Ncwane family went through. Can people also please show respect by not buying the DVDs, and if they can, could they rather show us where they are being sold so we can report this.” The gospel sensation died on December 5 of complications related to kidney failure.
