Kotas are some of the most popular foods in South African townships. Over the years, as they've grown more and more popular, several Kota franchises have been popping up all over the place. Kotas are popular for its combination of flavours, which can include ingredients such as chips, russians, burger patties, lettuce, cheese, viennas, eggs, beans, atchaar and pretty much anything tasty you can think of. Hosted over the weekend at the Soweto Theatre (opposite Jabulani Mall), SASKO Soweto Kota Festival will be showcasing some of the most delicious kotas from around the country. The festival will feature a competition to adjudicate which vendor made the best Kota. SASKO will then be giving the winning vendor R15 000 cash and air time on Jozi FM to advertise their business. It'll be interesting to see how this delicious dish is reinvented by vendors and what creative ways they go about their craft.
