Cape Town - Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane is on private visit to Israel, just two days after Jacob Zuma called on South Africans not to visit the Jewish state. South Africa's foreign ministry did not organise Maimane's visit, but did assist in setting up the meetings between the DA leader and a number of Israeli officials. Despite the visit being a low-key one, Maimane is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, opposition leader Isaac Herzog and other senior officials. Maimane is being accompanied by Michael Bagraim, a Jewish member of parliament from Maimane s Democratic Alliance (DA) Party. He is expected to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials, including opposition head Isaac Herzog and Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat. IOL
