A new restaurant mobile app is making spontaneous dining easy with just a tap of a button. 
Feastfox has launched on Cape Town and is the first of its kind in South Africa. 
The spontaneous eating-out app allows you to book a table at one of their 60 partnering restaurant without having to call or wait for a table. 
The launch area currently includes the Cape Town CBD, V&A Waterfront, De Waterkant, Green Point, Sea Point, Gardens, Vredehoek & Tamboerskloof.
The app lets you choose from a number of restaurants including, Reuben’s, Kyoto Gardens Sushi, La Boheme, Nobu, Culture Club Cheese, Clarke’s, Hokey Poke, Scheckter's Raw and Shio. 
Once your selection is made, state the number of guests and tap to make your booking. When your booking is confirmed (which barely takes a minute) you have 30 minutes to get to the restaurant.  An incredible dinner for two with my ONE @meganbaadjies thanks to the guys at #feastfox #smartfoodie A post shared by Tshego (@tshegofatsang) on Aug 23, 2017 at 2:40pm PDT  Feastfox co-founder, Stuart Murless, says the app was designed for those last minute “let's eat out” moments. “As the founders of feast fox we are all young professionals with busy lives, we weren't really planning ahead and making bookings,” Murless says. 
“We found that generally when we ate out it was spontaneously. "Whether it be after drinks and you decide to go out with friends or you go home and you decide to go out for dinner or you just want to treat the person in your life to a spontaneous fine dining experience, Feastfox was created to fit into our lives.
“The app lets you discover restaurants, bars and cafés that are nearby and that has availability right now.”
Once your restaurant is selected, you can explore the venue and the meals by scrolling through the photographs. 
“One of the cherries on top is that some of the restaurants may be running what we call treats on the app. It might be a winter special, a two for one menu, a glass of wine- something that they’re offering as an incentive to bring you in,” Murless explains. We tried the app and visited Reuben’s restaurant at the One and Only in the V&A Waterfront for the winter menu, one of the specials on the app. Upon our arrival our table was ready and waiting.The app is easy to navigate and it conveniently directs you to Google Maps once your booking is made. 
All that’s left for you to do is to hop into your car, uber or walk and enjoy a night of spontaneous dining. Treated to an incredible feast at @shio_izakaya with @feastfox tonight 🦊🦊🦊! Feast fox is a fantastic last minute restaurant booking app that helped us grab the last table available! Have you downloaded the app? Loving the last minute convenience and in app specials!
