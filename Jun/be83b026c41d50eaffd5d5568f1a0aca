Munich - Sebastian Vettel may have to appear before the International Tribunal of the ruling body FIA for driving his Ferrari into Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes at the Azerbaijan Formula One race, according to Germany's Auto, Motor und Sport magazine. The magazine said on its website on Wednesday that FIA president Jean Todt was considering such a move, with possible sanctions for Vettel, because the German's action was deliberate, and that the FIA will decide within the next days. An official statement from the FIA was not available immediately. On Sunday in Baku, then race-leader Hamilton seemed to slow suddenly and the following Vettel could not avoid making contact from behind. Vettel reacted to what he deemed to be brake-checking by immediately drawing level with Hamilton and turning his car into his rival in a deliberate act of revenge. However, race stewards subsequently cleared Hamilton of any wrongdoing and said he maintained a reasonable pace. The championship leader Vettel received a 10-second penalty for the offence during the race which he finished in fourth place. Hamilton placed fifth. DPA  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
