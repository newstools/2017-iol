Dumi Masilela's family have slammed recent claims that the late Rhythm City actor's widowed wife is pregnant with his child. Dumi was shot in his abdomen during an attempted hijacking in Tembisa on 2 August. He later died of his injuries in hospital. News of Simphiwe Ngema's alleged pregnancy surfaced on fake news sites and social media this week, along with a supporting video of ultrasound scan of 'baby Masilela'. Dumi's brother Mbongeni Masilela told TshisaLive the reports are "outrageous". He added that  the family is still in mourning and would not entertain the rumours. "I don't want to respond to nonsense... It is ridiculous... outrageous," Mbongeni said. "We don't pay attention to what is being said... we knew Dumi and we know what it true and what is not."
