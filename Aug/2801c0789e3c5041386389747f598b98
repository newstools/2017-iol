Shinji Okazaki struck early and Harry Maguire netted a header from a corner as Leicester City beat Brighton 2-0 at the King Power Stadium on Saturday, handing the Premier League newcomers their second straight defeat. Japanese international Okazaki was on hand to rifle home the rebound from a Riyad Mahrez shot in the first minute as the 2016 Premier League champions got off to a flying start in their first home game of the season. Mahrez was also behind Leicester’s second goal, swinging in a corner early in the second half for Maguire to head home his first goal for the Foxes. Brighton had plenty of possession in the second half, but once again had a hard time fashioning decent goal-scoring opportunities, with Leicester able to coast home. Meanwhile, Charlie Austin scored a stoppage-time penalty as Southampton beat 10-man West Ham United 3-2 in a thrilling Premier League game in which Javier Hernandez netted his first goals for the visitors. Hernandez’s double either side of halftime had seemed to complete an astonishing comeback for West Ham, who trailed after Manolo Gabbiadini and a Dusan Tadic penalty put the Saints two up with their first home league goals since April. In between, West Ham’s £24 million striker Marko Arnautovic received a straight red for elbowing Jack Stephens in the face, his second dismissal against Southampton in two seasons. But West Ham refused to buckle and Mexican Hernandez thought he had done enough to earn a point before referee Lee Mason adjudged Pablo Zabaleta to have fouled Maya Yoshida deep into added time. Austin converted the spot-kick to inflict the Hammers’ second consecutive defeat. “It was a difficult game because we had everything under control after a sending-off and two goals,” Saints manager Mauricio Pellegrino said after overseeing his first Premier League win. “I could not see the penalty decision from the bench, we have to respect the decision.” Reuters
