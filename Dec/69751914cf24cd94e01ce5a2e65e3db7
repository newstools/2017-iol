Johannesburg - It’s taken a while for Nissan’s latest-generation Patrol to reach South African shores, almost eight years in fact, considering that it was first released abroad back in 2010. Yet while the sums never worked out to bring it here back then, with the previous generation soldiering on instead, Nissan SA has now decided to bring the latest one here. Details are still under wraps at this stage, with Nissan SA planning to release the pricing and additional details next Wednesday, December 6. For the record, overseas models are sold with 205kW V6 and 298kW V8 engine options, with some markets such as the UAE also getting a 319kW Nismo version - because that’s how they roll in the desert. All engines are mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission and a multi-mode four-wheel-drive system, and Nissan claims a towing capacity of 3500kg. Technically the latest gen Patrol has already been on sale in South Africa, in the form of the plusher Infiniti QX80 that was based on it.
