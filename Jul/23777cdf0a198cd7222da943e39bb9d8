“Our goal is to create a tool that would allow visualizing
any design project as if it was a physical 3D model. It would allow a user to
see their future house, layout and all decor details with real-life precision.” Read also:  Decorating apps let you virtually arrange new furniture What the App does is recognize walls, furniture and house
design model created with the app by using image recognition technology.
 It then creates a 3D model of the house from a simple photo. All you need to do is take a photo with your Smartphone,

the house. The 3D project then allows you to edit and rearrange

Apple, Google, Microsoft and others, as they work on their own AR and VR
technologies. Alexey Sheremetyev said:” There is an exciting future for
interior design, when Smartphone’s start integrating advanced AR technology,” This would be a huge leap  forward also for anyone
