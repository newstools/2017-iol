"The Office of the Premier has, as a result of these unfounded and fabricated claims, decided to suspend its working relations with the SABC, this to afford the corporation time to investigate these allegations," said provincial government spokesperson Brian Setswambung. He said the decision to suspend the relations was to curb further encroachment accusations against the premier on the corporation's editorial policy, whilst the investigation is being carried out. "What is more surprising to us is that the SABC in the North West has on a number of occasions, been invited to the premier's monthly media briefings to discuss some of the service delivery issues in the province, only for SABC journalists to ask questions and report on issues that were not even part or focus of the presser. And the premier has always welcomed and fielded such questions, with facts." Weekend newspapers reported that Mahumapelo dictated how news stories about him should be reported on television or radio.
