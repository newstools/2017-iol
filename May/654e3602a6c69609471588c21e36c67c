A source said: "Liam one hundred percent has settled her down. I think Miley realised that she pushed him away and she regretted it. She doesn't want to make that same mistake again." And the 24-year-old singer has been making a lot of changes in the recent months, including quitting smoking pot. Rappers ready to battle it out with One Mic The insider added to E!
