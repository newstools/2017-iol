Beirut/Ankara - The Turkish government's spokesperson on Wednesday said that the United States' decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel will plunge the region and the world into "a fire with no end in sight". "Declaring Jerusalem a capital is disregarding history and the truths in the region, it is a big injustice/cruelty, shortsightedness, foolishness/madness, it is plunging the region and the world into a fire with no end in sight," Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Twitter. "I call on everyone to act logically, respect the agreements they signed and behave reasonably, avoid risking world peace for domestic politics or other reasons," he said. US officials have said President Donald Trump is likely to give a speech on Wednesday unilaterally recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a step that would break with decades of US policy. Iran has also objected to the decision. The US intention to move its embassy to Jerusalem is a sign of its incompetence and failure, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday, according to his official website. "That they claim they want to announce Quds as the capital of occupied Palestine is because of their incompetence and failure," Khamenei said, using the Arabic name for Jerusalem.

"On the issue of Palestine (US) hands are tied and they cannot advance their goals," Khamenei said. He said Palestine would be "freed" and Palestinian people will be victorious. He said the United States wanted to start a war in the region to protect the security of Israel. "American government officials have said themselves that we have to start a war in the region to protect the security of the Zionist regime," Khamenei said.  Reuters
