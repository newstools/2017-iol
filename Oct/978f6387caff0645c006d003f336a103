JOHANNESBURG – Proteas stalwart seamer Vernon Philander will make a return to action for the Cape Cobras against the Dolphins in their Sunfoil Series match at the Recreation Ground in Oudtshoorn on Monday. The 46-Test veteran has completed his rehabilitation after a back scare that kept him out of the Test series against Bangladesh. The injured former South African seam bowler Rory Kleinveldt will join the squad as a bowling consultant. Zubayr Hamza, the No 3 batsman for the Cobras, has been an immovable object since answering the call to replace the injured Simon Khomari in Port Elizabeth against the Warriors this season. He has struck 111, 41, 29 and 34 in the past three games. “I have had three starts since my century in Port Elizabeth. I feel my gameplan at the start of my innings is solid, and I won’t change the mental space I am in,” Hamza remarked. “But I must push on. I need to play the ball, not the player,” he said about his intention to score more centuries. Cape Cobras Squad Dane Piedt (captain), Aviwe Mgijima, Pieter Malan, Zubayr Hamza, Vernon Philander, Jason Smith, Justin Ontong, Simon Khomari, Mthiwekhaya Nabe, Kyle Verreynne, Michael Cohen, Lizaad Williams.
