Bitou municipal lifeguards, the NSRI sea rescue craft Airlink Rescuer and Ray Farnham, NSRI rescue swimmers, the SA Police Service, Medlife ambulance service, and the NSRI station doctor all responded. "A 51-year-old Austrian man was rescued from the water and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) efforts were commenced on the man on the beach, and these efforts were assisted by a Canadian doctor and by a German doctor who happened to be on the beach at the time," he said. "Despite extensive CPR efforts sadly the man was declared deceased and... police have opened an inquest docket. Counsellor services are being provided to the wife of the deceased man and tourism officials and the Austrian Consulate are assisting," Lambinon said. African News Agency
