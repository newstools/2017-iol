This year’s Free State Madeira Flower Festival promises to be bigger and better than last year. Hosted in the small town of Parys, the highly anticipated Free State Madeira Flower Festival will take place on November 24 and 25. 
 
A joint venture between the Governments of Free State and Madeira, Portugal, the annual Free State Flower Festival is an ambitious vision that was seeded and grown within a partnership between Free State Premier, Ace Magashule, and Madeira President Miguel Albuquerque. A vision that was realised last year in the biggest flower festival South Africa had ever seen. The second Free State Flower Festival is set to be a colourful surge of entertainment, floral displays, and a music concert featuring local artists with President Albuquerque and Magashule in attendance.
 
The Free State Gambling Liquor and Tourism authority CE, Kenny Dichabe, said last year’s event was a landmark event for South Africa. Over 30,000 visitors from all over the world streamed into the little town of Parys last November for two days of floral heaven. Dichabe said: “The inaugural event was an incredible success, and of course we intend to do nothing less than raise the bar and delight our visitors even more than last year.” The ultimate highlight is the 1km flower parade through Bree Street. The Palesa Parade is one of the largest choreographed dance movements in South Africa. The short one and a half hour drive from Joburg makes Parys an easily accessible weekend playground for city slickers looking for a little respite. And apart from its annual flower festival, Parys is continuously brimming with both culture and adventure.
