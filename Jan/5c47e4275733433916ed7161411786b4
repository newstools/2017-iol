Refilwe Phofa of the Nu Metro Bedfordview (Vip cinema) said that whenever they have such events, the tickets are sold out almost immediately. "Women cherish such days where they are treated extra special and get to have quality time with their friends or family while watching a great movie" she added. The Nu Metro Bedfordview recently added other nice perks like a relaxation lounge and ordering food while you watch a movie. The ladies seemed to having a great time and even won prizes from sponsors, which were handed out by a DJ from Mix FM. A photo posted by Nu Metro (@numetro) on Jan 12, 2017 at 11:18am PST IOL
