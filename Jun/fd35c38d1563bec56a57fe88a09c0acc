JOHANNESBURG - Lungi Ngidi has been withdrawn from the South Africa A squad for the remainder of their tour of England as he has developed a back injury. No replacement will be made.   “Lungi has developed a bone stress reaction in his back, which is not an uncommon injury in young fast bowlers,” explained Dr. Shuaib Manjra, chairperson of the Cricket South Africa (CSA) Medical Committee.  ´He will return to South Africa and undergo further assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for this injury by the CSA Medical Team. We will not be able to give a timeline on his likely return to the game until we have made a further assessment,” concluded Dr. Manjra.
