Doha - Palestinian Islamist group Hamas
supports the establishment of a transitional Palestinian state
along the borders from 1967, its leader Khaled Meshaal said on
Monday. "Hamas advocates the liberation of all of Palestine but is
ready to support the state on 1967 borders without recognising
Israel or ceding any rights," Meshaal said in Doha on Monday
announcing a new policy document. In 1967 Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and East
Jerusalem in a war with Arab states. Israel withdrew from Gaza
in 2005. A state along 1967 borders is the goal of Hamas' main
political rival, the Fatah movement led by Mahmoud Abbas. Reuters
