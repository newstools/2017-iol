#WorldWhiskyDay is tomorrow 20 May and it’s the perfect time to get to know the spirit a bit better. The annual celebration of all things whisky takes place on the third Saturday of May every year and was started in 2012. Although there are official #WorldWhiskyDay events there is nothing stopping you from just enjoying the spirit in the comfort of your own home. If you’re not a whisky connoisseur but you still want to get into the spirit of things then why not try a simple whisky sour cocktail A shot of bourbon whisky, with fresh lemon juice and a dash of sugar syrup in a cocktail shaker and then strained into a glass is a great way to start with a whisky sour. You can even add egg white foam if you want a cocktail that's going to look great on your Instagram or Twitter feed. A good quality whisky is going to cost you though but it doesn’t need to break the bank. You can get a good quality 12 year old whisky at the liquor store and only need to fork out about R500. If you want to make a better drinking investment though then I suggest the Macallan 15 year old which is a very pleasant and balanced whisky. It’s not going to sting your throat (the main complaint from those who don’t like whisky) and it’s been triple cask matured in sherry casks and American Bourbon casks. You want to try a shot of it neat, before adding ice cubes and water if you want to get the best from your whisky and value for money.  But if you still hung up on the price point but are determined to enjoy #WorldWhiskyDay then the Private Barrel Co at Checkers has the No 68 12 year old Single Malt on it’s shelves for under R300. It’s a great tasting, fragrant malt that’s just a bit spicy and oak-flavoured but not over powering at all. You’ll still be able to impress friends and family with a great drink that doesn’t cost the earth. No matter which whisky you choose or how you choose to drink it, #WorldWhiskyDay is the perfect time to raise a glass and cheers to the joys of whisky.
