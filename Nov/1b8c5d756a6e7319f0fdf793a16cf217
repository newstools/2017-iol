For the fifth consecutive year, Cape Town’s Pepperclub Hotel & Spa has been named Africa’s Leading City Hotel at the 24th annual World Travel Awards™ regional Africa Gala Ceremony, recently held in Rwanda.
 
“Not only is this considered a major achievement for our hotel, but awards like the World Travel Awards™ - lauded the Oscars of the international tourism industry – continue to putCape Town on the global tourism map and, in turn, boost the country’s GDP and further job creation,” says Chantal Maxim, spokesperson for the Pepperclub Hotel & Spa.
 
“Since Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba announced in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement that GDP growth has been forecast at 0,7%, down from 1,3% percent as tabled in the February Budget, it is imperative that the tourism sector remains a stable contributor to our GDP,” adds Maxim.
 
“Last year, the travel and tourism industry contributed R402bn (9.3%) to SA’s total GDP and is expected to grow by 2.5% to R412.2bn (9.4% of GDP) in 2017*,” explains Maxim. She continues, “In the Western Cape alone, significant tourism growth continues to be reported, with international arrivals growing by more than 18% last year and growth of 16% recorded in the province’s domestic tourism market.”
 
Commenting on the achievement Maxim remarked: “We are delighted to have been recognised yet again, and our staff and management remain committed to delivering the highest quality experience to all our guests, ensuring that both business and leisure travellers continue to flock to our beautiful city.”
 
“Given the international reach of the awards, the exposure for the hotel, as well as Cape Town, is significant. Having competed against other exceptional hotels across Africa, this award cements the Cape Town tourism industry as an internationally acclaimed destination,” concludes Maxim.
