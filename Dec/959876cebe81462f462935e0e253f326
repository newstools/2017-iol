NYON, SWITZERLAND - Wembley Stadium in London will host four Euro 2020 matches originally set to be staged in Brussels, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said on Thursday. The European football governing body's executive committee decided "unanimously" to strip Brussels of its four matches due to the inability of Belgian organisers to guarantee the new stadium to the north of the capital where they would have been held could be built in time. The building project for the new Brussels stadium for Euro 2020 had run into delays due to the applications for construction and environmental permits. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said that the four matches originally planned to be staged in Brussels would be played at London's Wembley stadium instead, including the two semi-finals and final already scheduled to be played there. Wembley will now host seven matches, including the two semi-finals and the final on July 12, 2020.    AFP   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
