Oslo, Norway - Even conservative Scandinavian countries have their share of road trolls, but this one is really special, as he cuts in front of a truck (a very big one, judging by the height of the dashcam) over a double barrier line on a blind bend, and then brake-tests the truck. And when the inevitable happens, heâ€™s all ready to pick a fight with the trucker, even though he seems to be paying more attention to his phone than to the real world - tweeting the incident, maybe? The Norwegian courts took a suitably dim view of the incident; the Mini driver was slapped with a fine and, more importantly, his driving licence was suspended for 11 months.
