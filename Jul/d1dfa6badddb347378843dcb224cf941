London - Victoria Beckham is at the centre of an extraordinary row over her part in designing a special edition of the Range Rover. Gerry McGovern, 61, design director at Land Rover, which makes the cars, has accused the former Spice Girl-turned-fashionista of exaggerating her role at the launch of a special VB Evoque, where she claimed: "I’ve designed a car that I want to drive, a car I think [husband] David wants to drive." But Mr McGovern said at a publicity event last week: "She didn’t design the car… I’ve forgotten more than that woman will ever know about [car] designing – to be a car designer takes years. When we went to China to present it, she stood up in front of the world’s press and said, 'When I designed this car…' I said, 'Victoria, that wasn’t on the script.' "She said, 'Oh, I didn’t realise what I was saying.'" His irritation goes back to 2012 when Mrs Beckham, 43, was asked to create a version of the Evoque with "restrained colour and detail changes", as the company explained. But not to "change the award-winning design". The car featured matt paintwork, vintage-inspired leather seats, ‘rose gold accents’ inspired by Mrs Beckham’s watch, mohair trimmings and a leather luggage set. "We never said she designed the car – that’s an assumption people made," said Mr McGovern. In one interview, Mrs Beckham said: "I wanted to really roll my sleeves up and get involved. I never just put my name on anything… I was very hands-on." Mrs Beckham’s launch speech clearly still irritates Mr McGovern, who said last week: "I didn’t want to work with her after that." Land Rover said: "The three-year project was completed in full by both parties and was a huge creative success around the world. Mrs Beckham remains part of the Land Rover family." Mrs Beckham would not comment. Daily Mail  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
