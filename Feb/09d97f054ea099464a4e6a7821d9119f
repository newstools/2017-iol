Families are in for a treat at this year’s NickFest as pop star Shekhinah and rapper Nasty C (pictured) are expected to take to the stage. The Back to the Beach songbird and the Bad Hair rapper will have the crowd on their feet as they perform their hits. They will both perform two songs each day at the two-day event, which will take place at the TicketPro Dome in Randburg next month, with event organisers saying other artists would be announced. The pair will be joined by comedians Jason, Nicholas and Donovan Goliath, who will host the kids’ festival. Nickelodeon characters such as SpongeBob Square- Pants, Dora the Explorer, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and lovable pups Chase and Marshall from Paw Patrol will also make special appearances. Besides the live performances, preschoolers, tweens, teens and their families can look forward to interactive zones and kid-friendly activities. This includes an interactive graffiti wall, playing on the Magic Kinder app in the KinderJoy interactive area and hanging out with the KinderJoy mascot Kinderino. There will also be a slime-wall where those attending can swim and dunk each other in thousands of litres of slime. The NickFest is a collaboration between children’s TV programme Nickelodeon as well as Glen21 Entertainment and KinderJoy. Tickets for the events are available through www.ticketpros.co.za as well as select Edgars, CNA and PostNet outlets. Prices ranges are R290 per head or R270 per person for a family of four to six people. Groups of 10 or more enjoy a discounted price of R250 per head while entrance is free for children under one. Entrance to the Slime Area costs R150 per person, and tickets for this are sold separately.  The Star
