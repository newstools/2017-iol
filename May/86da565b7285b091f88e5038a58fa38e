Ever since the two-litre flat-four Toybaru came out five years ago, Scoobie fans have been saying, “It’s nice, but nice doesn’t cut it – it needs more bite”. But nothing has been forthcoming from Fuji Heavy Industries, other than cosmetic and minor engineering updates. Even the Japan-only limited-edition BRZ tS boasted no more than the standard 147kW. It’s as if the Blue Meanies have concluded an gentleman’s agreement with joint venture partner Toyota to ‘play nice’. But now Subaru has posted this picture of a BRZ with boot-mounted STI wing on its social media pages with the cryptic message: “Stay tuned… 8 June 2017 #STI”.  The cybergarage promptly begun buzzing with rumours and speculation about the new sportster – whether it will have the 197kW WRX turboboxer (logical, but since when has Subaru been logical?), a smaller turbocharged engine (more likely, we fear) or even the fire-breathing 221kW 2.5-litre flat-four turbo of the current STI (wishful thinking, Cyril, in this political climate) – and whether it will have two or all-wheel drive. Or maybe it’s just another dress-up exercise based on the proven two-litre mill – which would be a waste of a very sexy wing. Either way, in a week and a day we’ll know and, as soon as we do, so will you. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
