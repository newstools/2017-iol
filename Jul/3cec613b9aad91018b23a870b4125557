Johannesburg - The Helen Suzman Foundation, Section27 and Save South Africa have written to PR firm Bell Pottinger in request for information that will form the basis of an investigation into the company's actions, it was announced on Tuesday. This follows news that the former Gupta PR firm will face a disciplinary hearing over their involvement with Oakbay Capital and the controversial Gupta family. The civil society organisations in a statement said they noted the “unequivocal and absolute apology” issued by Bell Pottinger for their involvement with the company "The above three organisations, acting jointly, have now approached Bell Pottinger with a request for access to the terms of reference and all information which will form the basis of the investigation which is to be undertaken by the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP. "This request flows from the intention of the HSF, Section27 and Save SA, to make recommendations to the relevant UK regulatory bodies, in order to assist these bodies in coming to a proper understanding of the social, economic and potential legal implications of Bell Pottinger’s conduct." HSF, Section27 and Save SA also expressed concern over Bell Pottinger's conduct, adding that it should be viewed "in the correct context by Bell Pottinger’s own senior management, by the UK regulatory bodies and by the public at large". "In arriving at any conclusions about Bell Pottinger’s conduct, it is plainly necessary to have an appropriately informed understanding of South Africa’s constitutional project, the legal framework, its history regarding race and sectarian politics, andthe challenges which the country faces."
