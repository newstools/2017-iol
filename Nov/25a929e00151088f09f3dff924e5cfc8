Macau, China - This spectacular pile-up shows why the Macau street circuit is regarded one of the most unforgiving on earth. As the field dived into Police bend - one of the tightest parts of the circuit - on the opening lap of the GT World Cup qualifying race, Mercedes driver Daniel Juncadella, who was running fourth at the time, hit the wall just after the apex.   Only Raffaele Marciello was able to avoid the crashed Mercedes, before 2016 GT World Cup champion Laurens Vanthoor, in sixth, came round the blind corner, hit the back of Juncadellaâ€™s Mercedes and blocked the entire track, which is little more than two cars wide at that point. And the rest of the field - all 14 of them - piled into them, hard enough that Lucas di Grassi's Audi R8 LMS ended up on top of a BMW. Race direction immediately called for red flags, the race having already been effectively halted. Other than the three leaders and the incredibly lucky Marciello, only four cars made it back to the grid for the restart, after the track had been cleared. IOL Motoring
