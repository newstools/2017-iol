ON THE FRONT LINE Andries Ferreira and Franco Mostert versus Scott Barrett and Sam Whitelock The unheralded Ferreira was a surprise selection three years ago, but he has fully justified the faith shown in him by his coach he’s a grafter of the highest order and does the basics brilliantly. Then there’s Mostert, pictured, the king of lineout steals, the never-stop-working energiser bunny who puts in more tackles than locks are supposed to. Facing them are Barrett - yes, another Barrett whose brothers Jordie and Beauden were in the Hurricanes team last week - and Whitelock, pictured, the captain and undoubtedly one of the leading No 5s in the game, a master in the lineouts. It’s a fascinating match-up. IN THE BACKLINE Harold Vorster and Lionel Mapoe versus Ryan Crotty and Jack Goodhue The midfield battle is expected to provide plenty of thrills, with both combinations firing at this pinnacle point of the season. Vorster, pictured, has been a revelation at 12 - powerful in defence, but it’s been his running lines that have caught the eye, while Mapoe, pictured, continues to produce high quality performances from one week to the next. He hardly makes mistakes, is always probing with ball in hand and has an expert eye for the gap. For the Saders, Crotty, pictured, is the defensive organiser and a man not too many players get past, while Goodhue has shown, like most New Zealand centres, he is a player with plenty of skills. @jacq_west  The Mercury  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
