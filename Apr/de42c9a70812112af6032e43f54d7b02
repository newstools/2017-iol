  Valencia, Spain – It’s well known that one of the most effective ways to get a baby to go to sleep is put the crib in a car and go for a gentle drive; it’s the only way to get some infants to drop off at all. Ford Espana recently used that almost universal truth as the basis of an ad campaign for its Max MPV range, creating the Max Motor Dreams baby crib, complete with gentle engine sounds and car movements, LED lights to simulate passing street lights – and even an app to record your baby’s favourite drives and play them back at home. Now the company has been swamped by so many “Where can we get one?” queries from frazzled parents of sleepless infants that it has set up a website to handle them and is considering putting the Motor Dreams crib into production.
