Former Fifth Harmony star Camila Cabello has revealed why she was reluctant to work with other artists on her solo album. Camila Cabello was reluctant to work with other artists on her solo album because she "collaborated for five years" as a member of Fifth Harmony. READ: Camila Cabello finishes debut solo album The 20-year-old singer-songwriter left the chart-topping girl group in December last year and has revealed that her much-anticipated solo effort won't feature many collaborators. But, during a conversation on SiriusXM, she added: "I would love to do something with Kendrick Lamar. The 1975. I don't know if you guys know them. Yeah, they're awesome." Camila also admitted that in the immediate aftermath of leaving Fifth Harmony, she felt under pressure to deliver a hit record. But now, the brunette beauty has a more philosophical approach to her music. She explained: "I remember feeling super nervous, but there was a time where I was like, 'It doesn't matter that much. It's music! It's not that deep." Meanwhile, Camilla previously admitted she felt like she's had to "prove" to her collaborators that she's a real artist. The singer - who has worked with the likes of Diplo and Shawn Mendes - said: "I just really wanted to prove to people that I had something to say and that I wasn't just a singer, that I was an artist, that I had a point of view and knew exactly the song that I wanted to write or the lyrics. "The first few weeks were me really wanting to prove that to people and prove to myself to. People I was writing with were like, that's actually a really great lyric, or that's a really good idea, or oh yeah we should do that! "That made me less and less insecure to the point where by the end of it, I feel like the last studio session I went to, I would come in and know exactly what I want and not be afraid to say it."
