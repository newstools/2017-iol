Johannesburg - The new Hino 500 Wide Cab, says parent company Toyota, is more than a model change, albeit the first for this range in 14 years; the line-up has also been enlarged to include 6x4 variants and even an automatic transmission. There are new wheelbase options - long and super long  - as well as a choice of steel springs or airbags (including a remote control to lower the truck for ease of loading) as well as three heavy-duty 6x4 models for site works, available with on or off-road cabs. The new 500 Wide Cab will go into production at the Hino assembly plant in Prospecton, near Durban, in early November and, when it goes on sale early in 2018, customers will have a choice of three engines, rather than just one. The previous 184kW, eight-litre J08 engine is replaced by your choice of the JO8 Lo, rated for 191kW and 794Nm, the J08 Hi, good for 206kW and 883Nm, or the 11-litre P11 prime mover, delivering a claimed 257kW and 1275Nm. Transmission is via either six-speed or nine-speed manual gearbox, with the option of Allison 3000 or 3500 six-speed automatic transmissions for certain models, and an upgraded rear differential with longer gear ratios to improve fuel-efficiency. The chassis frame - common to all models - is now bolted together rather than riveted, with a hole pattern on the web surfaces for easy body mounting, and the frame rails are wider apart at the front to make space for the bigger P11 engine. That also allows for a wider front axle, increasing its load rating from 5.5 to 7.5 tons and reducing the turning circle, while a new trunnion rear suspension also allows for a cross-differential locking system on 6x4 models. The cab is appreciably wider than that of the previous version - hence the name - and has an extra step for easier access. Road models have semi-floating cab mountings, while the three heavy-duty versions have full-floating cabs to improve ride comfort on rough terrain. Air suspension is standard on the driver’s seat, as are central locking, a driver’s side airbag, seatbelts with emergency locking retractor, improved headlight spread an adjustable hill-hold system for easier uphill starts, aircon, cruise control and an audio system. The dashboard layout has also been revised for improved ergonomics with both analogue and digital instrumentation.
