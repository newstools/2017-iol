BMW has added some new features to its 3 Series sedan range while also spicing things up with two new special editions. For starters, LED headlights and foglamps are now standard on the 3 Series, while the cabin has been given a digital pimping. To that end, 3 Series buyers can now opt for BMW’s TFT digital instrument cluster, which can be personalised via the Driving Experience Control Switch. BMW has also updated the graphics of its iDrive infotainment system while those opting for the Professional navigation system will also get touch-screen functionality. Buyers also get additional exterior colour choices (including Sunset Orange), new alloy wheel choices, and new interior upholstery and trim strip options. As for the new special editions, the Edition Sport Line will be available in 318i guise only, while the Edition M Sport Shadow applies the the rest of the range from 320i to 340i. Let’s see what they have to offer. Edition Sport Line Shadow You’ll tell this one apart from ordinary 3 Series sedans by its black colour treatment for the grille surrounds, lower air intakes and headlight assemblies, as well as its darkened taillights and two-tone 18-inch alloy wheels with contrast Jet Black colouring. Inside you’ll find a new sports steering wheel, sports seats upholstered in a leather and cloth combination, a contrasting seam on the instrument panel and some new interior garnishes in the form of Dark Aluminium Carbon and Pearl Gloss Chrome. The Edition Sport Line Shadow commands a R44 900 premium over the standard 318i, with the manual priced at R537 600 and the eight-speed auto at R586 000. Edition M Sport Shadow The Edition M Sport also gets the black treatment for the grille, headlights, taillights and lower air intake, but gains the M Sport front bumper as well as 19-inch ‘M’ alloy wheels and Chrome Black tailpipes. BMW has also thrown in the M Sports suspension system for this edition as well as its Driving Experience Control with Sport+ mode. Black leather sports seats with blue contrasting seams set it apart inside, along with contrast stitching on the dashboard and a combination of Pearl Gloss Chrome and Dark Aluminium Carbon interior garnishes. That’s in addition to an M leather steering wheel, Anthracite roof lining and M door sills. The Edition M Sport Shadow models command a R29 400 premium over regular M Sport 3 Series derivatives. Here’s what you’ll pay: 320i (from R605 700), 320d (R638 500), 330i (R684 000), 330e (R831 700), 330d (R774 500) and 340i (R830 600).  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
