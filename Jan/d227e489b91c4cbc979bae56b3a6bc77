Johannesburg Cement producer PPC says, after it implemented its new empowerment scheme, it has seen a net R1 billion inflow. This cash, which came as its partners and community groups brought 15.6 million shares, will be used to further debt and fund capital expenditure, especially the Slurry kiln 9 project. The company also bought back and cancelled 48.6 million shares at 10c each, it says. This means its net stated capital is now at 1.6 billion shares as its net capital dropped by 33 million shares. However, it says, the deal reduced its empowerment credentials, and it is working on a new deal, which will be communicated by June.

Nyanga said PPC s current BBBEE transaction had also run into sustainability problems because it had relied heavily on a positive trajectory in PPC s share price, but due to weak market conditions PPC s share price had been under sustained pressure. At the time, Business Report said PPC s existing BBBEE transaction dates back to December 2008. It involved four strategic black partners (SBP) - women s empowerment group Nozala, black-owned and managed Peu, empowerment investment firm iLima Portland Consortium and broad-based group Capital Edge Cement Consortium - and two community services groups (CSG).
