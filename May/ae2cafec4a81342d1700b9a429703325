Ghanaian international midfielder Christian Atsu's performances for Newcastle United in regaining their Premier League status earned him a permanent move from champions Chelsea on Wednesday. The 25-year-old – who scored five goals in 32 Championship appearances as the Rafael Benitez-coached Magpies topped the table – signed a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. The transfer to Newcastle is subject to Atsu successfully reapplying for a work permit. "We are happy to sign a good player," Benitez told the club website. "He's shown us that he's a good professional and someone who is very keen to learn and improve. "Christian has been a key part of our promotion campaign and he wants to help us to build something for the future." Atsu, capped over 40 times and a member of the Ghana side that reached the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations final only to lose on penalties to Ivory Coast, never played a game for Chelsea after joining them for £3.5 million ($4.5m, 4m euros) in 2013 from Portuguese giants Porto. Instead Chelsea loaned him out to Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem, Everton and Bournemouth as well as Spanish outfit Malaga. AFP
