Mrs Tourism International ambassador Ntombi Gumede is doing everything she can to promote South Africa as a destination of choice. Ntombi started her  tourism journey in 2015 when she was crowned Mrs Tourism South Africa, and a year later she took the Mrs Tourism Africa title. IOL Travel chats to the jetsetter to find out more about her travels. First holiday memory? It was in  Mauritius for my honeymoon in 2011. My husband and I had so much fun enjoying activities like parasailing, boat trips and braaing on the island. Best holiday? In 2013, I took a  family trip to Dubai with my husband and children. There was something for everyone. I enjoyed shopping, my children loved  Kidzania and the water parks and my husband enjoyed the dunes. What has your travels taught you?  I've learnt that each and every destination is precious. It is very important to travel and get to know and appreciate different cultures, their cuisine and language. Favorite city? Durban. I feel the city is the best tourist attraction in Africa. We have the best hotels, best services and entertainment to keep all travellers happy. Holiday reading? There is hardly ever time to read when I travel. I prefer being outdoors and making the most of the time I have at a destination. I only read the hotel information booklets and the room service menu.
