Imagine sitting at a table across Brangelina. Or sleeping in the same room that Justin Bieber slept in. These are some of the faces that have been spotted at the hotels we list below. See what makes these hotels amazing and which famous faces you may bump into at the corridors. 1. Hotel Monte Vista, Flagstaff – Arizona, USA This hotel carries more of a historical significance with it being famous during the 1920s  American prohibition era. It is believed that people could buy alcohol here during this era. There are also tales of haunting that happens at the hotel, the most famous one being of a woman that is spotted sitting in a rocking chair...If ghost stories are not for you, then rather focus on the celebrity side, where you can find sleeping in room 403 where legendary British guitarist for the band Queen slept. Or in room 307 where Debbie Reynolds, renowned film star and mother of beloved Carrie Fischer once slept. It's a win-win really. Today the hotel stands proudly in Flagstaff Arizona as a firm part of the city life. Travelers still delight in the ability to sleep in these rooms where the rich and famous spent some time. It has simple rooms that are simply decorated and it is a major part of the city's nightlife.
