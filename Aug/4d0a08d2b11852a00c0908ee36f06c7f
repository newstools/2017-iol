Johannesburg - We see a lot of them on the roads, but actually quantifying the popularity of Kia and Hyundai vehicles in South Africa has been a difficult task until recently. In July, the local distributor of the two South Korean brands, Motus, started reporting monthly sales figures for its individual models to Naamsa for the first time. Although it was sometimes possible to obtain retrospective sales figures, this is the first time that we’re able to compare Kia and Hyundai sales to those of their rivals, directly and on a monthly basis. So without further ado, let’s take a closer look at how popular these Korean cars were in July. As you’ll see below, where we’ve compared a large selection of Hyundai and Kia models to their most popular rivals, the two brands feature prominently in many of the segments in which they compete. Kia is a strong contender in the compact hatchback game, while Hyundai is doing rather well among the smaller and medium-sized SUVs. However, the two brands do lag a little in the Corolla class as well as the large SUV segment.
