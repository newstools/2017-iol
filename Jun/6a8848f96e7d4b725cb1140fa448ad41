The Durban-north based teacher says while we can all use yoga in our lives to correct physical pain and ailments, it is much more than exercise. “Yoga is meditation, whether you’re just focusing on your breathing or focusing on moving through the postures, be aware – paying attention to your body – as being mindful in yoga is a way in which to experience life more fully.” It’s simple but powerful, she says. “Don’t take your cellphone to your class. Take the time out to be present. “Breathe. Be aware of your body and what’s going on with you. Notice the muscles and movement and what you’re experiencing. “Yes, yoga maybe a part of your fitness routine, and perhaps you’re striving to get the postures correct; however, it’s important to get out of your head. “Honour your feelings. Be kind to yourself, by listening intuitively to your body. “Yoga is a way of training your attention. To move, to meditate, to sit and breathe and be completely in that moment. You are teaching yourself to sustain your own being. Mindfulness is being employed in psychology and all areas of work to reduce stress and a variety of mental and physical conditions. Yoga is the tool for your well-being.
