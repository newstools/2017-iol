Seoul - &nbsp;Jay Y. Lee, who heads South Korea's massive Samsung Group, was given a $5 box meal for lunch and did not sleep in over 22 hours of questioning in a corruption scandal involving impeached President Park Geun-hye.Lee, who has a net worth of $6.2 billion and is the third-generation leader of the country's biggest conglomerate, or &quot;chaebol&quot;, left the special prosecutors' office in southern Seoul on Friday morning in what appeared to be the same suit and tie he'd worn when he entered a day earlier.The tall, bespectacled 48-year old did not look visibly affected by the session, in which he was questioned by two prosecutors, including one nicknamed the &quot;Chaebol Sniper&quot;.Lee did not speak to reporters before getting into a waiting car.&quot;Two prosecutors interrogated him and they came in and out of the room to report to their chief,&quot; a prosecution official told Reuters.&quot;None of them - prosecutors or Jay Lee - slept before the questioning was over,&quot; the official said.The official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Lee's lawyer was present during the questioning.Prosecutors have been investigating whether Samsung provided 30 billion won ($25.46 million) to a business and foundations backed by the president's friend Choi Soon-sil in exchange for the national pension fund's support for a 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates.Lee was named as a suspect on Wednesday and summoned for questioning on Thursday morning. He became the de facto head of the Samsung Group after his father Lee Kun-Hee was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014.Read also: Samsung chief questioned by prosecutorsSamsung has acknowledged making payments to two foundations at the centre of the scandal, as well as to a consulting firm controlled by Choi, but has repeatedly denied accusations of lobbying to push through the merger of Samsung C&amp;T Corp and Cheil Industries Inc.Park was impeached by parliament in December, a decision that must be upheld or overturned by the Constitutional Court.
