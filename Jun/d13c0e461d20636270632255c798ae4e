Nizaam Ajam, 42, from Mitchells Plain, dubbed the ‘Plain Paedo’, was convicted last year on 180 charges of sexual crimes against children. He sexually groomed children to create child pornography, which he distributed. He was convicted of using a child for the purposes of child pornography, exposing children to pornography, distributing child pornography, encouraging self-sexual assault, rape and extortion. Ajam entered into a plea agreement with the State and received 20 years imprisonment last year. He fell ill in April while being held at Pollsmoor Prison and was admitted to Tygerberg Hospital. Last month, Head of Communications in the Western Cape for the Department of Correctional Services, Simphiwe Xako, confirmed Ajam was ill, but stated that he wasn’t released, but transferred to the Brandvlei Maximum Security Centre. “Pollsmoor has informed me that offender Nizaam Ajam is currently at the Brandvlei Maximum Security Centre. He was, however, admitted to the Tygerberg Hospital on 23 April due to ill health,” Xako stated. Ajam’s funeral was held on Tuesday. He was buried according to Muslim rites. It is not clear what he has died of. Daily Voice
