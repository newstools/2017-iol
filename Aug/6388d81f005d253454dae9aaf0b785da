Justin Bieber's father has flown from Canada to Los Angeles to spend some quality time with his pop star son. Jeremy Bieber, 42, jetted in to LA from Ontario, Canada, last weekend with the pop star's half-brother Jaxon, seven, and he was spotted driving around in a convertible behind the 'Never Say Never' hitmaker's vehicle. Sources have told gossip TMZ that Jeremy has flown over to spend some time with his son after a tough last month in which he axed the remaining 14 dates of his 'Purpose World Tour' and accidentally hit a photographer with his car. It's not known how much Justin has seen Jeremy this year but his dad is said to be keen to reconnect. There has been speculation Justin may have dropped the remainder of his tour dates to focus on religion, but Hillsong Church pastor Carl Lentz is not thought to have agreed with the singer's decision and advised him not to pull out of the gigs. A source recently said: "The church didn't tell Justin to cancel the tour." Justin is thought to have chosen to axe the concerts to focus on "spiritual soul-searching". The insider added: "He made his decision based on spiritual soul-searching and his own view of the path in life he should be taking." Last week, Justin accidentally hit photographer Maurice Lamont in his vehicle when he was driving away from a Hillsong religious meeting, but the paparazzo insisted the 23-year-old star is a "good kid". He said: "Hours before my birthday hits, I get ran over by Justin Bieber. Isn't that something? "He's a good kid though. I think the truck is a little big for him. Cause there is no way he could see over the front." Justin's mother is Pattie Mallette, while Jeremy also has two children, Jaxon, and nine-year-old Jazmyn, from his seven-year relationship with Erin Wagner, which ended in 2014.
