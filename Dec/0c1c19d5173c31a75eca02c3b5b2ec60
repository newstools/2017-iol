It can’t be denied that South Africa produces some of the best music on the continent. We have Grammy award winning artists who call Durban their home and one of the biggest DJ’s at the moment, Black Coffee, is proudly South African.  This year we saw a number of new artists break into the industry and some of our old favourites release new music. We also saw the birth of a new genre, Gqom. Here is a list of songs that kept us on the dance floor in 2017. Distruction Boyz - Omunye featuring Benny Maverick and Dladla Mshunqisi  Sun-El Musician featuring Samthing Soweto - Akanamali Kwesta featuring Wale - Spirit AKA & Anatii - Don’t Forget to Pray  Shekhinah - Suited  Sands - Tigi De Mogul SA featuring Ms Mo & Makhensa - Oe Batla Kae
