Tel Aviv - The world's oldest man, Holocaust survivor Israel
Kristal, died Friday in the Israeli city of Haifa at the age of 113. Kristal's daughter, Schulamit Kristal, confirmed her father's passing
to dpa, following reports of his death in the newspaper Haaretz. The Guinness Book of Records awarded Kristal the title of world's
oldest man in March 2016. Kristal had most recently celebrated the 100th anniversary of his Bar
Mitzvah, the Jewish celebration of religious maturity, in late 2016
with his family. A party for his 113th birthday was held on September
15. Born on September 15, 1903, in the Polish village of Zarnow, Kristal
was deported to Auschwitz in 1944 and lost his first wife and two
children during the Holocaust. He emigrated to Israel in 1950. He leaves behind several children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren. dpa
