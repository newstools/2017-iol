&nbsp;Johannesburg Lonmin is maintaining its full-year guidance at between 650&nbsp;000 and 680&nbsp;000 platinum ounces despite a disappointing first quarter.In a statement issued to shareholders on Thursday, the listed platinum producer, added unit costs should remain unchanged at between R10&nbsp;800 and R11&nbsp;300 per platinum group metal ounce.Its Marikana mining operations, including Pandora, produced 2.3 million tonnes during the quarter, down 7.8 percent or 200&nbsp;000 tonnes on the comparative period partly due to the planned decline from the closing of its high cost shafts. While the first quarter of our financial year is historically our lowest producing quarter, the mining performance was disappointing with production at our generation 2 shafts down 5.2 percent from the prior year period. Lonmin adds the implementation of initiatives to improve productivity is taking longer we planned, especially around improving absenteeism. However, we remain committed to delivering sustained productivity improvements at our operations to ensure the long-term viability of the business. It notes the reduction in Section 54 stoppages has continued, with tonnes lost due to Section 54 safety stoppages down by 71 percent in the quarter.Its biggest shaft, K3, produced 590&nbsp;000 tonnes, down a disappointing 13.8 percent on the previous period.Read also: Lonmin remains under pressure This shaft was most impacted by the reorganisation from 2016 and, during the quarter, experienced high management induced safety stoppages resulting in 60 000 tonnes of lost production. Overall, the relationship between operational management and unions at this shaft is not working as effectively as we expected and the yielding of results from the implementation of business improvement initiatives at this shaft is taking longer than we would have liked to see. As a result, it is deploying additional stoping and vamping crews to the shaft to take advantage of the immediately available ore reserves and improve production, it says.Rowland shaft produced 42 ,000 tonnes, an increase of 9.6 percent on the prior year period as this shaft is now starting to gain the production benefits from improved safety performance.Saffy shaft produced 493 000 tonnes, broadly in line with prior year period, demonstrating that the shaft is maintaining its steady state performance.4B produced 336 000 tonnes, a decrease of 10.7 percent on the prior year period as a result of higher than planned frequency of intersecting geological features and changes in middle management.However, Lonmin says, the performance at the Generation 1 shafts is in line with its plan and it is successfully executing the strategy to reduce high cost production in a low price environment. Tonnes mined from these shafts were 500&nbsp;000 tonnes, or 21.8 percent lower.BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE&nbsp;&nbsp;
