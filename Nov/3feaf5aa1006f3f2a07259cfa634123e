Parliament - President Jacob Zuma said the legal fees to be paid by the State for him challenging the reinstatement of 783 corruption, fraud and racketeering charges was not his problem, but was the fault of the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA). Answering questions in the South African Parliment's National Council of Provinces (NCOP), Zuma said he won't foot the legal bill in his personal capacity. "I'm not going to pay from my pockets and change from what are the rules. If the DA, if it is so sympathetic, they will not be taking people to court all the time. You can't have the cake and eat it. You just wasting our time really," Zuma said. In October, Zuma and the National Prosecuting Authority lost its Supreme Court of Appeal bid to overturn a high court ruling setting aside a decision to withdraw the charges against the president. Also read: Who will pay the bill? The DA had taken the matter to court, arguing the 2009 decision to withdraw the charges by former National Director of Public Prosecutions Mokotedi Mpshe was irrational. "The DA goes to court on everything and therefore cause the money of the taxpayers to be paid in defence of those who are working in government. It is your responsibility, it is not my responsibility," said Zuma. "If you take someone to court, you must know that somebody must defend the case. If that somebody is working in government and the case is arising out of when the president was working, by law, government pays. It is not my problem." African News Agency
