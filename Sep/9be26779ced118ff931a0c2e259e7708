Cape Town - Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) leader Julius Malema has inspired a gqom track that's trending on social media. The three-minute thirty-nine second track, titled '#uBaba ka Duduzani' was produced by Tboy Daflame, who is a medical student according to his Twitter profile. The track was inspired by Malema's reference to President Jacob Zuma as "Duduzane's father" during the recent vote of no confidence. During a debate on the motion of no confidence in Parliament in August, Malema labelled Zuma as the "most corrupt individual in the country". "We are not here today to remove a democratically elected government of the ANC Â which was voted for by our people in 2014," Malema said. "Whether we like it or not we must at all times respect the wish of the people. That's why we are here today to make it very clear that ours today is not against the ANC but against the father of Duduzane (Zuma's son). "We are here to remove Duduzane's father. Duduzane's father is the most corrupt individual in this country" Zuma's son, Duduzane Zuma, is a confirmed business associate of the controversial Gupta family. The reference has since garnered popularity and inspired Tboy Daflame's upbeat track. A 44-second video promoting the song including a link to download the full track was shared on social media.  The song has since received quite a bit of praise on social media and the full version of the video has been viewed over 13 000 times on YouTube.
