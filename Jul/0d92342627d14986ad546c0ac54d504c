Durban - As expected, several local celebrities attended one of the major social and fashion events on the South African calendar. Spotted in the crowd were Top Billing presenter Ayanda Thabete, Skeem Saam actress Amanda Du Pont, who by the way isn't at all that sweet young lady we see on our daily Instagram feed. DJ Tira rocked up at his marquee in a helicopter, wearing a pink brocade suit. Dineo Moeketsi wore Quiteria. Everyone was waiting for Babes Wodumo to make a grand entrance. We are still waiting... Miss South Africa, Demi Leigh Nel-Peters wore a playsuit with a voluminous overskirt by Anel Botha. She was excited about her first bunny chow and also revealed she's a foodie.    The Edison Property Group, which always hosts the well-heeled guests at the July, pulled out all the stops. Hosted by Vivian Reddy and Sorisha Naidoo, the guests included business people and some politicians who didn't attend the ANC policy conference. Making an appearance for the first time, the Soweto VIP Marquee had a great vibe and friendly people - hopefully they will be back next year.Â 
The Afrotainment Marquee could also fall under the top five best marquees to be at this year.    Full of fun and excitement and great music with DJ Tira playing host. Later, he also rocked Moses Mabhida Stadium People's Park for the best after-party in town along with AKA, Cassper, Kwesta, Ricy Rick, Black Motion. This year, The Vodacom Durban July definitely brought back the party spirit that was missing for a long time.
