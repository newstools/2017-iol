Title-chasing Cape Town City will rue a host of missed scoring opportunities which saw them held to a goalless draw by Bloemfontein Celtic in an Absa Premiership match at the Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein on Saturday night. The result sees City move back to the top of the league table with 39 points from 21 matches, with Bidvest, who are in CAF Champions League action this weekend, on 38 points from 19 games. City, still trying to wipe away the embarrassment of their shock Nedbank Cup last-32 round exit to ABC Motsepe League (Mpumalanga) side Acornbush United last weekend, looked the more organised of the two sides. City’s midfield sensation Lebogang Manyama proved to be more than a handful for the Celtic midfielders to cope with, as was Aubrey Ngoma, whose pace down the right flank created some stressful moments for the Celtic rearguard. City striker Lehlohonolo Majoro had the best scoring chance for the visitors after receiving a pass from Manyama, but the former Kaizer Chiefs man shot wide of the target during the early part of the first half. At the other end of the field, City goalkeeper Shu-aib Walters’ workload didn’t really extend him, although he was called on to tip a powerful shot from Lanthshene Phalane over the crossbar. Roland Putsche was booked in the first half for a late challenge, while Celtic’s Namibian midfielder Deon Hotto received a caution in the second period. Lehlohonolo Seema, the Celtic caretaker coach, managed the team from the bench in the absence of new mentor Luc Eymael, who was unable to be in the hot seat as he is still under the cloud of an appeal lodged by his former club, Polokwane City.
