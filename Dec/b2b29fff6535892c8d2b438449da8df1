CAPE TOWN - The Cape Town International Airport said it is expecting to pass the 10 million passenger mark for the second year, it reported on Friday. The airport said, besides a huge number of domestic passengers heading to the Cape, it has witnessed growth in international passengers of around 20% over the past two years.  Corporate Affairs senior manager at the Cape Town International Airport, Deidre Davids said, "It is wonderful that the Western Cape is such a sought-after destination and the whole region benefits greatly". Davids added that "It is also inevitable that this kind of passenger traffic generates pressure points in and around the airport".  However, the airport's staff are said to be fully geared up to identify and cope with challenges across the airport precinct. "If there are problems we ask passengers to let us know and to bear with us while we deal with any issues," Davids added.  ALSO READ: Cape Town airport the best in Africa The airport, considering this December's business, has urged passengers to get to the airport earlier than they might normally do.  "This ensures that flights are not delayed and that there is enough time to deal with any problems. Getting here early also reduces some of the stress that especially families can experience in the middle of holiday crowds," Davids elaborated.
