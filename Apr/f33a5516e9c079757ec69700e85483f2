IPSS Medical’s Paul Herbst said they were busy with a priority one patient that had been mauled by her own dog. She suffered severe vascular and muscular damage, he said. The woman had been treated by paramedics and was then rushed through to Umhlanga hospital due to her extensive injuries. Herbst later said there was a change of plan due to the particulars of her condition. “The lady is now being rushed through to eThekwini Hospital to a vascular surgeon as her extensive injuries were compromising her due to restricted blood flow.” The dog bite happened near Salt Rock, he said. In January, a child died after a dog turned on her outside her grandmother’s Mayville residence. A Merebank man died in hospital in November last year after being mauled by three pit bulls close to his home. He was at least the third person to be killed by dogs that year.
