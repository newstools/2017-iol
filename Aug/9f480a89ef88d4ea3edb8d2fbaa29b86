Murfreesboro, Tennessee - A Tennessee bride was arrested hours after saying "I do" when authorities say she pointed a gun at her groom. Murfreesboro police Sgt. Kyle Evans says officers responded to a report of Prichard and her husband arguing at a Clarion Inn motel a few hours after they were married. Police say witnesses reported that Prichard pulled a 9 mm pistol out of her dress, pointed it at her husband's head and pulled the trigger. The gun wasn't loaded. Police say Prichard then loaded a round in the chamber and fired a shot in the air. It's unclear if Prichard has an attorney. AP
