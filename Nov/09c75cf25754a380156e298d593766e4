BETHLEHEM – A late flurry of goals at Goble Park resulted in a 1-1 Absa Premiership draw between Free State Stars and Chippa United on Wednesday night. Overall it was Chippa who had the better chances on the night, and they could have made it a fourth straight win if they had been more clinical. As it stands though, Teboho Moloi’s side are on a nine-match unbeaten streak in the league (which includes six draws). The Chilli Boys looked bright in possession in the opening moments of the game, but failed to test home keeper Badra Sangare. Their first chance came in the 24th minute when they earned a free kick in a promising position, but Kurt Lentjies, back from the injury he incurred in a collision with Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, fired over the bar. The hosts grew stronger after the half-hour mark and the first real chance fell the way of Stars forward Sinethemba Jantjie, but from close range, he was denied by Chippa keeper Daniel Akpeyi seven minutes before the interval in Bethlehem. The second period got off to a much livelier start, and there was action at both ends as Akpeyi did superbly to keep out a long-range stinger from Paulus Masehe, while at the other end, Sangare blocked Paseka Mako’s shot from close range before the rebound was ballooned over. Lentjies then squandered another chance for the Eastern Cape side after some good work by Phetso Maphanga had created an opening in the 64th minute. Moeketsi Sekola fired an 18-yard shot just wide of the upright as Chippa continued to press for a goal, but instead it was Ea Lla Koto who took the lead through Edward Manqele just five minutes from time. It was not to be the winner, however, as the Chilli Boys were stung into action and levelled matters only two minutes later when James Okwuosa headed in a Menzi Masuku corner.
