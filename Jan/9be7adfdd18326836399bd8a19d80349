London - Anglo American on Thursday reported higher minerals output across its portfolio at the end of last year and said it would achieve a 2 percent increase in copper production for 2016 as a whole, adding to a batch of new material.&nbsp;Copper has been billed as the bulk commodity most likely to run into short supply and commodity traders are watching production figures from big miners as they debate future price strength.&nbsp;Analysts said Anglo American's figures were broadly positive despite production challenges at Los Bronces in Chile.&nbsp;They say equity holders are likely to carry on investing in a sector-wide recovery, led by Anglo American, which was the biggest gainer on the FTSE100 Index in 2016 after steep declines in 2015.&nbsp;Anglo American said it had seen operational improvements across its portfolio that delivered a 4 percent increase in copper in the final quarter of 2016.Read also: Anglo American cuts copper target&quot;Together with positive contributions from ongoing ramp-ups at Minas-Rio, Grosvenor and Gahcho Kue, we will be reporting a 2 percent increase in copper equivalent production volumes for 2016 as a whole,&quot; CEO Mark Cutifani said in a statement.&nbsp;Los Bronces output remained difficult, falling 19 percent as grade quality deteriorated, weather was bad and contractors carried out &quot;illegal industrial action&quot;, Anglo said.&nbsp;Anglo American has put copper, along with platinum and diamonds, at the heart of its portfolio.&nbsp;It said production at its diamond unit also rose 10 percent in the last quarter of 2016 compared with a year earlier as output was boosted in line with improved trading conditions relative to a difficult 2015.&nbsp;For platinum, up 2 percent, Anglo American said it continued to &quot;maintain discipline by mining to demand&quot;.&nbsp;Also on Thursday, Kaz Minerals, a copper company focused on large scale, low-cost open pit mining in Kazakhstan reported 73 percent year-on-year output growth as new production came online.&nbsp;&quot;We successfully ramped up Bozshakol and the Aktogay oxide plant,&quot; CEO Oleg Novachuk said. &quot;Our growth will continue in 2017 as Bozshakol reaches capacity and we commence production from sulphide ore at Aktogay.&quot; Kaz Minerals also said full-year gross cash costs would be around 20 percent less than the previous guided range of 140 to 160 US cents per pound of copper.&nbsp;Anglo American's share price was up 1 percent by 0815 GMT, bringing gains so far this year to 28 percent.
