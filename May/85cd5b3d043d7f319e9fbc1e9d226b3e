A fan girl caused a frenzy in a shopping mall after dressing up as Justin Bieber and making Beliebers out of bystanders. Krizz Solano, 19, dressed up in a grey hoodie, sunglasses and a black jacket before walking through a shopping mall in Costa Rica. Fans believed she was the 'Love Yourself' hitmaker and started to chase after her. They even asked to take pictures with her.  It seems Solano even fooled the security guards. As the chaos ensued, she was rescued by security guards who led her through an emergency exit as the ‘fans’ tried desperately to touch her.  IOL
