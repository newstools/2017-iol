Durban KwaZulu-Natal recorded the most vehicle crashes during the festive season, followed by Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West province, yet it was Limpopo that saw the most fatalities.This is according to a trend analysis by the Department of Transport. However, the official statistics are only due to be released later this week by Transport Minister Dipou Peters.Ishmael Mnisi, of the Department of Transport, said the province that recorded the most road deaths was Limpopo, followed by Mpumalanga. KZN is ranked third and the Free State fourth, although this could change as holiday-makers return home in the coming days.Drinking and driving was said to be the main cause of these crashes.According to Mnisi, about 47% of crashes involved private passenger cars. This was followed by bakkies and taxis. However, taxis accounted for more deaths because of the number of people they carried.Overall, there were more crashes involving taxis this December period than last year. Of those who died in taxi crashes, 23% were drivers and 39% passengers.Mnisi said they had identified more unroadworthy taxis than last year, even though many of these unroadworthy vehicles had roadworthy certificates from private institutions.He said the department would investigate why roadworthy certificates were issued to vehicles that did not meet the necessary standard.Daily News
