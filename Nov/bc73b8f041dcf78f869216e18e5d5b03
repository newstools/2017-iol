Phra Pradaeng, Thailand - Toyota has revealed a facelifted version of its Hilux bakkie in Thailand, although the changes only apply to the upper end of the range, with lower-spec models retaining the current look. But will SA models receive these changes? At this stage Toyota South Africa cannot confirm this, stating "Hilux is often tailored to individual market requirements and not all changes are applied across global markets at the same time." This implies that we could see some of the changes at a later stage, albeit with local adaptations. The updated models receive a redesigned front bumper, incorporating larger and more muscular looking grille inspired by the latest Land Cruiser Prado and 200 SUV models. Toyota has also added a sportier range-topping version called the Rocco in an apparent attempt to take on the Ford Ranger Wildtrack. These versions are distinguished by a grey and glossy black grille (with no chrome surround as on the other versions) as well as by black-painted mirrors, wheel arch mouldings and 18-inch wheels, a sports bar and a ‘Rocco’ body graphic on the side of the load bin. That theme continues in the cabin’s colour scheme which also includes black metallic trim. According to the Toyota Thailand website, the Hilux continues to offer the familiar 2.4-litre and 2.8-litre turbodiesel and 2.7 petrol engines, in 4x2 and 4x4 guises. Ford meanwhile is also working on a facelifted version of the global-market Ranger, which is likely to be revealed in 2018. The upgraded Ford bakkie will also include a high-performance Raptor version, which will be built in SA and launched in 2019. Now where’s your response to that, Toyota? IOL Motoring
