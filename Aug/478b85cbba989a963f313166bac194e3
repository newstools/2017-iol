Silverstone, Northamptonshire - A 1972 Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, once owned by Elton John, was knocked down for £551 250 (R9.65 million) including premium, right in the middle of the auctioneers’ pre-sale estimate, on the final day of the racing and classic car auction at the Silverstone Classic Motor Racing Festival at the weekend. It is one of only 158 genuine right-hand drive GTB/4s ever built, and still has its original Ferrari red paint, while the interior has been painstakingly re-trimmed in original black leather, complete with genuine Ferrari perforated inserts.  The 365 GTB/4 was introduced in 1968 as Ferrari’s answer to the mid-engined Lamborghini Miura of 1966. Thanks to a 4.4-litre quad-cam V12 rated at 260kW, it was faster than the Miura, while the perfect weight distribution afforded by its rear-mounted five-speed gearbox, and its superb servo-assisted, ventilated disc brakes, gave it better road manners.
