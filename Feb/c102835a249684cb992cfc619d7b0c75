The annual Sanlam Top Destination Awards, in its third year running, plans to expand this year with additional entries, more guests at the awards ceremony, extravagant décor and further prolific sponsorship opportunities with the theme of Authentically African #MyHeartBeatsAfrica.  The awards have been designed by Discount Traveler to uplift the hospitality industry in South Africa by acknowledging top accommodation establishments as key industry players.  The managing director of Discount Traveler, Jonathan Pepler, said the Sanlam Top Destination Awards received a great response last year. “We are building a brand that will continue to show recognition to one of our country’s most influential industries and one that has a positive impact. The hospitality and tourism industry in its entirety is a driving force in our economy and to simply play a small role in this, is significant to the bigger picture, “We strive to uplift that local family business that has put blood, sweat and tears into their establishment, to show people the utmost dedication that goes into running a guesthouse or B&B as well as to recognise the four and five-star hotels that are doing everything right in terms of service offering and deserve an applause,” he said.  Entries are open to all accommodation establishments in South Africa and there are nine categories available to enter. Entries have opened on February 1, 2017 and voting will commence from March 1, 2017. Voting is open to the public. Votes are tallied and the top establishments are then judged according to an internal set of criteria. Nominees are named and winners will be announced at the awards ceremony on Thursday, September 14, at the Cape Town City Hall.
