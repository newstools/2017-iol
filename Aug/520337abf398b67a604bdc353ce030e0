JOHANNESBURG – The Premier Soccer League (PSL) renewed its sponsorship with Absa for a further five years on Monday night, to stretch the union that has lasted for 10 years to 15. PSL chairman Irvin Khoza and group executive of marketing and corporate affairs at Absa, Bobby Malabie, signed the agreement worth R500 million at SuperSport’s offices in Randburg. The sponsorship amount remains as it has been in the last five years, which means that the prize money for the Absa Premiership winners of R10 million will remain the same. “The last 10 years of this partnership have demonstrated that for a relationship to enjoy longevity, both sides must have common goals that glue them together,” Khoza said. “As we renew for a further five years, we would like to thank Absa for their trust and confidence in the PSL as the best vehicle for their message to millions of people. “As we continue with the sponsorship, we do know that for this partnership to remain impactful, it cannot be business as usual. We have to continuously innovate to remain relevant. “We are therefore excited about some of the innovations coming up in the 2017/18 season, including the ‘Absa Premiership rivalry weekends’.” The concept of “Absa Premiership rivalry weekends” is to hype up the different regional rivalries, like the Soweto and the Tshwane derbies, with a number of fan activations and a kick for R1 million competition. The 2017/18 season kicks off on Friday, with defending champions Bidvest Wits taking on Cape Town City. @NJABULON  IOL Sport
