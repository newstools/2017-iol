Tokyo, Japan - Honda has promised an all-new electric sports car – the Sports EV Concept – at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show on 25 October, as part of a broad range of new cars and motorcycles. Without giving any technical details, Honda’s media release mentions a compact bodyshape with a striking silhouette - the rendering shows a two-door fastback coupé - a ‘friendly face’ (whatever that means!) and smooth surfaces with no obvious sharp edges other than a classic Kamm tail in place of a bootlid spoiler. The concept, says Honda, combines an electric powertrain and the latest AI driver aids to make the driver feel part of the car - which presupposes that the concept is a runner, rather than styling mockup. 60 years of Cubs Also on show in Tokyo will be the Urban EV Concept – first seen at Frankfurt earlier in September - the NeuV personal mobility concept and the all-new CR-V, each making its Japanese debut, as well as a range of Super Cub motorcycles celebrating the model’s 60th anniversary. These will include an anniversary Super Cub 110 model to celebrate its 100 million production milestone and a new Super Cub 125C.   IOL Motoring
