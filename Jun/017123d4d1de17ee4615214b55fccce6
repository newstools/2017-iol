Les Ulis, France - We still haven’t been told which engine will power the upcoming Renault Mégane RS, due to debut at the Frankfurt motor show in September. But after his demo drive at the Monaco Grand Prix, Renault F1 driver Nico Hulkenberg was invited to take part in a chassis development session at the historic Montlhery circuit near Paris. His comments on the car’s 4Control rear-wheel steering system (isn’t that the worst pun you’ve ever seen in a car name?) shared with the Mégane GTS, and which Renault says is a first for a production hatch, make interesting listening. But when it comes to describing the difference between the manual and automatic-transmission versions - and the suspension set-up of the Sport and Cup chassis - he gets a bit more outspoken.
