Ingredients 1 tbsp vegetable oil 3 eggs, lightly beaten 2 salted mackerels in soy bean oil, flaked 1 tbsp of the soy bean oil 4 red Asian shallots, finely chopped 1 kg boiled rice, or boil up 400 g uncooked long-grain white rice ⅓ teaspoon salt 2 spring onions, cut into rings Soy chilli dipping sauce, to serve Method Save the oil and use it to fry the rice, for a more intense flavour. Heat the vegetable oil in a wok over high heat. Pour the eggs over the base of the wok and cook for 1-2 minutes, rotating the wok to ensure the omelette cooks evenly. Remove from the wok. When cool enough to handle, roll the omelette into a cigar shape and roughly chop. Wipe the wok clean and place over medium heat. Add the soy bean oil from the salted mackerel, then sautée the shallot until fragrant. Add the salted mackerel and cook for a further 1 minute. Now add the rice and salt. Keep tossing the rice and fish, as the rice can easily stick to the side of the wok. When the rice has heated through, add the omelette strips. Toss, then remove from the heat. Serve topped with the spring onion, with the dipping sauce on the side. The salted mackerel, or mam ca thu, is available in jars, ready to use, from oriental grocery stores. ‘Made in Vietnam’ by Tracey Lister & Andreas Pohl
