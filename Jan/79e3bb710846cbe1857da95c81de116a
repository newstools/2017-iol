It is also a plan to ensure that only male occupies senior positions at SAA.&quot; Read also: Bain to pilot SAA, Mango mergerThe ANCWL claimed that for about 82 years the same five companies have supplied SAA with jet fuel, which it said was an anomaly. &quot;SAA is not flying to Florida in the USA but there are workers [ghost] in SAA books and call centre at Florida [US].
