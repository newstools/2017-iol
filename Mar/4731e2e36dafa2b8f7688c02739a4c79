Kamp-Lintfort, Germany - Opinions at IOL Motoring are divided on this seriously attitudinous widebody kit from Prior Design for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class coupé.  We’ll leave that determination up to you - let us know what you think on Twitter or Facebook - while pointing out that the kit is purely cosmetic; underneath it the S-Class coupé is bog standard. And that’s fine, because even the entry-level S500 packs a wallop and the AMG versions are downright brutal.  The kit consists of a deeper front bumper, an add-on spoiler, framed mesh inserts for the air intakes, complete new front fenders with built-in wheel-arch flares extractor slots, ground-hugging side skirts, rear wheel-arch extenders, and a deeper rear bumper with a full-width diffuser and add-on lower spoiler. Optional extras include a custom bonnet with big DTM-style extractor slots behind the radiator, a full-width rear wing, suspension lowering kits, three-piece forged-alloy rims ranging from 18-23 inches, a free-flow exhaust system and a practically unlimited palette of interior upgrades. The composite body panels are reinforced with a mix of glass fibre and Duraflex matting that, according to Prior, combines a modicum of flexibility with consistent dimensional stability, making for an accurate fit (Prior says all the kit parts bolt straight on with no fitting needed) and an excellent surface for painting, with a minimum of preparation. The cost is subject to a multitude of variables, such as colour, surface finish and optional extra, so you’ll have to approach Prior design for a quote.
