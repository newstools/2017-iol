Toronto, Canada - With the announcement of the finalists in six award categories, the 13th annual World Car of the Year programme shifts up a gear - and becomes a lot more public. The World Car of the Year is adjudicated by a panel of 75 distinguished international motoring journalists from 24 countries, including South Africa's Hannes Oosthuizen. World Car Awards 2017 was launched at the Paris motor show on 29 September 2016, followed by five days of test drives in California after the Los Angeles auto show. The next step will be at the Geneva motor show on 7 March when the top three finalists in each categories will be announced, before the winners are revealed at the New York auto show on 13 April.
