A sofa is a big investment. It should be beautiful but functional and also a reflection of your style, Heloise McKee Mitchell, the founder and creative director of the decor website Mintwood Home, said. The rule of thumb is to play it safe with a neutral color that blends in easily with its surroundings. But rules were meant to be broken, and some homeowners prefer to make a big, bold and, yes, colorful statement with their couch by turning it into an accent, or even centerpiece, in an otherwise muted living room. Rich textures, jewel tones and colorful prints pack personality and add interest to your space. The Washington Post
