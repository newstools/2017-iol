 She keeps fit and admits to having had facelifts, but Anne Robinson has claimed that what really keeps her young at 72 is an active sex life. Encouraging others to follow her example, she said: ‘I hope all women my age are having sex, why wouldn’t they be? It’s what keeps me young.’ Robinson, a grandmother, divorced her second husband in 2007 and has  never remarried despite going on plenty of dates. ‘I don’t have a partner at the moment,’ she told the Sun. ‘I’ve had two husbands and they’re lovely.’ The Weakest Link host tried online dating app Tinder for a BBC documentary Britain’s Relationship Secrets. But she said no to an actor she didn’t think would ‘bring in a big income’. Miss Robinson said: ‘I just want a Tinder that’s CEOs and upwards.’  © Daily Mail
