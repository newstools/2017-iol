DURBAN – Platinum Stars are closing in former Mamelodi Sundowns winger Raymond Monama. Monama has been on trial with Dikwena for the past four weeks. The club are impressed by his displays, and he is set to pen a deal with the struggling Dikwena. Club administration manager Senzo Mazingiza confirmed that Monama is on the verge of signing for them. “The club is very impressed with Monama. We are planning to sign. We don’t have any pressure. He is a free agent. He can sign anytime, but we will conclude everything next week,” Mazingiza said. Monama was with National First Division side Royal Eagles last season. He was one of their stars, netting more than 10 goals for the KwaZulu-Natal side. Dikwena are struggling at the moment, having lost two of their league encounters this season. “We’ve also retained Bongi Ntuli on loan from Sundowns. We hope the two players will add value in our team,” Mazinga explained. @minenhlecr7  IOL Sport
