London - Gold fell half a percent on Friday and headed for its first weekly loss of the year, as a two-day rise in the dollar prompted some investors to cash in gains after the metal hit its highest since mid November earlier this week.The US currency pared some early gains but remained up 0.2 percent against a currency basket on Friday.That pulled gold down from Tuesday's high of $1 219.59 an ounce, and set it on track to end a four-week winning streak with a 2 percent weekly loss. Spot gold was down 0.4 percent at $1,184.11 an ounce at 1035 GMT, while US gold futures for February delivery were down $6.40 an ounce at $1,183.40.&quot;I think we've seen the high for the moment. We had a good start to the year, but we've run out of steam around $1,220,&quot; ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said. &quot;Overall, we're just waiting for more positive news.&quot;On the data front, we have GDP data out of the US,&quot; she added. &quot;If these are a bit better, ...the dollar could rise.&quot;Another leg higher in the US currency could spark fresh losses in gold, she said.The US economy is expected to have grown an annualised 2.2 percent in the last quarter, with a plunge in soybeans shipments weighing on exports but buoyant consumer spending and rising business investment underscoring its underlying momentum.The dollar has climbed for two days as markets refocused on Trump's pro-business policies and expectations the greenback would gain from rising border tariffs, lifting it off this week's seven-week lows and leaving it flat for the week.The absence of Asian buyers, particularly in number one gold consumer China, during the Lunar New Year holiday has also weighed on the precious metal, dealers said.&quot;Most of Asia is already off for the holidays, which is a good time for many to short the metal,&quot; Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong, said.&quot;You can see the bids are very weak, which shows the demand right now.&quot;Silver was down 0.2 percent at $16.72 an ounce, while platinum was 0.6 percent lower at $967.30. Palladium was down 0.3 percent at $719.10, after earlier hitting its lowest since January 4 at $708.97. The autocatalyst metal has lost more than 8 percent so far this week, its worst weekly performance since January 2016.&nbsp; Reuters
