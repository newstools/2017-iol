Paradise Valley reaches the same level of frightening realism that made CJ Box’s The Highway so terrifying. A sequel to that novel, Paradise Valley, makes an excellent conclusion to Box’s gripping The Highway Quartet novels that have evolved into a hunt for a serial killer who works as a long-haul trucker. The realistic fright factor soars because Box uses the FBI’s Highway Serial Killer Task Force as a base for Paradise Valley. Here, Cassie Dewell, chief investigator in the Bakken County, North Dakota, sheriff’s department, is obsessed with finding killer Ronald Pergram, an independent trucker who preys on truck stop prostitutes. Box keeps Paradise Valley taut, with twists that are as suspenseful as they are believable. Loot.co.za (R362)
