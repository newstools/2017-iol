The team that can afford to throw all their resources into the cup are the youngest of the lot, ABC Motsepe League amateurs KwaDukuza United who took shape this season after the club were bought as Natal United and relocated from Msinga to the coast. They are mid-table in the league, with little prospect of promotion, and can afford to concentrate all their energies on the David versus Goliath mission against PSL big brothers Ajax Cape Town this weekend. They also boast neither injuries nor suspensions, according to coach Thami Ngubane. The name will ring a bell to those familiar with the Nedbank Cup history. Three years ago Ngubane oversaw Thanda Royal Zulu’s penalty shoot-out defeat to Orlando Pirates at the same Last 32 stage, after the First Division side led 2-0 at one point in the clash. This time Ngubane is with a team one rung lower, and expects his youngsters to capitalise on the fact that they will be unknowns to their Cape opponents. The former African Warriors and Royal Eagles coach who took over the side just over two months ago wants to take advantage of their “closed book” status. He said they held several training sessions at the match venue, Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in Clermont, to familiarise the players with the pitch. “This team was formed six to eight months ago. I believe we have assembled a strong side that can hold off a giant like Ajax Cape Town,” said Ngubane. KwaZulu-Natal will definitely have at least one representative in the next round when Golden Arrows and Maritzburg United face off in a provincial derby in KwaMashu a week after they met in a league duel at the same venue. Arrows won 1-0. The other sides, AmaZulu and Eagles, make no bones about the fact that the league remained their priority, but promised to be competitive when they meet Platinum Stars and SuperSport United respectively next week.
