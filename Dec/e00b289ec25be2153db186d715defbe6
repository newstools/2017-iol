If you’re that friend who is inclined to bring chocolate, there is no better place to get it than De Villiers Chocolate in Franschhoek. Its owners, who started the business as a hobby in their garage, have created a fresh, chic atmosphere where chocolate, ice cream and coffee lovers can come together in celebration of the beloved cocoa bean. The artisanal chocolate is out of this world. The delicate truffles melt in your mouth. The flavours travel through your palate to tickle the exact spot in your brain dedicated to reckless delight. Flavours like burnt honey will have you singing the chocolatier’s praises. You’re able to mix and match in a variety of box sizes and pieces, but if you’re in a hurry you can always pick up a quick slab off the shelf. But you’d be doing yourself a disservice. De Villiers Chocolates implores you to sit down and relax in the courtyard in the Franschhoek sun and enjoy their delicate creations. You’re spoilt for choice with drinks, too - their coffees are comforting, and if you’re a serious chocolate lover, there’s a ridiculously decadent drinking chocolate on offer. Cape Argus
