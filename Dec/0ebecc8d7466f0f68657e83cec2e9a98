Johannesburg - A 25-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday in Westenburg, Polokwane for allegedly impersonating a police officer and robbing a man, Limpopo police said. Spokesperson Lt-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said that the man was arrested after he and his accomplice gave a man a lift in the Polokwane CBD.  "The two suspects drove with him until at a suburb outside the CBD where they produced a police appointment certificate, pointed him with a firearm,  demanded money and during that process, the victim screamed for help and the community reacted swiftly and arrested one suspect and his accomplice drove away with a white Ford Fiesta,", Ngoepe said. "The second suspect was identified and he is still being traced."   The man is expected to appear in the Polokwane Magistrate's Court soon on a charge of attempted armed robbery and impersonating a police officer.  African News Agency/ANA
