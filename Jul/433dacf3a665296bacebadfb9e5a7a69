Johannesburg - Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan has on Tuesday, urged government leaders to evaluate their performance according to former president Nelson Mandela's vision. "On Mandela Day, we ought to ask ourselves what aspirations Nelson Mandela and his generation had for our country. In part, we haven't fulfilled that aspiration," Gordhan told reporters at the sidelines of the Conference for the Future of South Africa in Johannesburg, organised by the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and Save SA. Gordhan said those in government should look back and evaluate themselves on whether they have achieved Mandela's vision of a prosperous nation, with less unemployment and poverty. "Clearly, those responsible must move aside if they haven't achieved those aspirations. We need to have the humility to say I've done my bit, perhaps I have overstayed my welcome.... let me leave it all for the next generation to take over and be a leadership that can fulfil the fantastic potential we have as a country." The conference delegates discussed ways to end state capture and would adopt resolutions to chart the way forward. They included members of lobby groups, watchdog organisations, African National Congress stalwarts and veterans, youth, women and labour federations. African News Agency
