Brand, Bavaria – We’re not the only publication that sometimes refers to AMG products as sledgehammers; but you can trust Mansory to make Mercedes-AMG’s GLS 63 top dog SUV even more brutal. The Mansory treatment starts with a high-flow sports air filter, a free-breathing sports exhaust system and proprietary ECU mapping, boosting the 5.5-litre twin-turbo V8 from 430kW and 760Nm to a claimed 618kW and 1150Nm, and top speed from 250km/h to a downright scary 295. But it’s the wide-body kit really says it all, from the custom bonnet and gaping air intakes in the new front apron, with integrated daytime running lights and clear lacquered carbon-fibre splitter, to the dramatic wheel-arch flares – 25mm in front and 400mm at the rear – over ultra-light 23 inch Mansory Y5/1 forged-alloy rims shod with 305/35 gumballs. Side flares, specially designed to reduce wind roar, lower and stretch the GLS’ profile, while airflow over the tailgate is controlled by a rear spoiler and a custom diffuser. Mansory also re-maps the standard air suspension, lowering the ride height (and the centre of gravity) by as much as 30mm for ‘significantly improved handling during fast cornering’.The interior is trimmed in specially selected fine leather; even the standard AMG multifunction sports steering wheel is refinished in the Mansory trim shop with fine leather and carbon-fibre, for a more luxurious feel while retaining all the functionality of the original. Regardless of the aesthetics, it’s a very intimidating package; if you saw this coming up behind you in your rear view mirror on the autobahn, you’d get out of the way, right? We would.
