Cape Town Sacoil, the South African based independent African oil and gas company, said on Monday that it had acquired a 71 percent interest in Afric Oil Group, one of the largest independent fuel distributors in South Africa. Following completion, Sacoil s portfolio will consist of operated production activities in Egypt, exploration in Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi and Botswana, a crude trading allocation with Nigerian National Petroleum Company and fuel distribution operations in Southern Africa.Afric Oil distributes more than 30 million litres of fuel product (diesel, petrol and paraffin) monthly to a diversified client base that includes local and national government, parastatals, blue chip mining and industrial customers and other non-refinery wholesalers of fuel products. A recent acquisition is expected to contribute an additional 16 million litres per month of fuel products. Dr Thabo Kgogo, Sacoil s chief executive, said the truly transformational deal was in line with Sacoil s strategy of diversifying operations into the downstream segments of the African oil and gas value chain and underpinning the business with low volatility and predictable revenue streams. The statement added that the acquisition was in line with Sacoil s strategy to become a fully integrated, pan-African industry player across the oil and gas value chain in Africa. Sacoil said it remained focused on delivering energy for Africa using the continent s own resources to meet the significant growth in demand expected over the next decade.The statement added that the acquisition of its first operational footprint in South Africa would also enable it to play a meaningful role in the socio-economic development of the country . Sacoil is acquiring Phembani Oil, which owns the 71 percent interest in Afric Oil, from Gentacure and its holding company, Moopong Investments Holdings, for a total of up to R200 million in cash and shares. This consists of an initial consideration of R147.3 million and another up to R52.7 million depending on Afric Oil s performance this year. The remaining 29 percent of Afric Oil is held by the Compensation Fund, a fund managed by the Public Investment Corporation (PIC).
