The Four Seasons The Westcliff Hotel launched on Tuesday this week their winter campaign. The campaign features the choice of three savory fondues, to be enjoyed by a minimum of four people. Fondue, traditionally a Swiss concept is dated back to the 1600s with the cheese fondue being the most popular. It is a mixture of four cheeses with seasoning. Depending on who is making it, white wine is also one of the main ingredients. Since the 1600s, there have been several variations of the dish, with the French developing a style and the Italians going their own route as well. There are also dessert fondues, with chocolate being the most popular but with variations made with  coconut, honey, caramel, or marshmallow. At The Westcliff, a team of chefs has created three fondues, a Classic Cheese, Carnivore and a Chinese Fondue for guests to enjoy. There is also the Belgian hot chocolate that is served  at the guests leisure. The available fondue options are the  Carnivore Fondue, which was a Oxtail Consommé, a form of clear soup, served  with strips of Angus beef fillet, veal noche, chicken fillet, portobellini mushrooms, pomme de pont neuf (soft fried potatoes) and broccolini with cognac pepper and horseradish that need to be cooked in the soup.
