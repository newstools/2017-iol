Johannesburg-  A mobile IT and Science Lab that will set the tone for inspiring students of Jabulani Technical High on the subject was handed over to the principal of the school, Mr. Ngwenya by the PPC LTD. The Lab is used as an alternative to underprivileged schools to aid with equipment for Technology and Science needed to conduct experiments covered in the high school science syllabus. In Addition, it ensures practical interactive demonstrations and allows revision in preparation for exams. Commenting on the handover, Kabira Akoob, CSI manager, PPC said," many learners still find science extremely inspiring and interesting even though the subject is considered tough to teach, with educators at times overwhelmed by the amount of material, and students simultaneously discouraged with the amount to master". The handover of the facility to the school is one of several such initiatives planned to benefit schools countrywide. Since September 2016, PPC has handed over 14 of the flagship Mobile Science and IT Labs. Through these, over 10 000 learners countrywide have already benefited as it will allow their career paths to grow and become South Africa’s next generation of engineers, scientists, and technicians. A major development in the evolutionary process of the PPC Mobile Science & IT Lab initiative has been the collaboration with the project partner, Diebold Nixdorf.  PPC has also joined hands with the Government as well as other corporate stakeholders to provide the critical science education infrastructure needed for this school. These include the Department of Basic Education and Department of Mineral Resources, Princess D Menstrual Cups, Caster Semenya and Hip Hope Foundation. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
