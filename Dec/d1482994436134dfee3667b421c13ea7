New York - The members of Dire Straits, Bon Jovi, The Cars and
The Moody Blues, as well as Nina Simone, will be inducted into the
Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, the institution announced on
Wednesday. The official induction ceremony will take place on April 14, 2018, at
the Hall of Fame in Cleveland, in the USÂ state of Ohio. "We are very happy about it," Bon Jovi frontman Jon Bon Jovi told The
New York Times. "I really want to say it's about time." The Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was established in Cleveland in 1983.
The decision over who to induct each year is partly based on online
voting, and partly on the opinions of around 600 music industry
experts. dpa
