Berlin, Germany - Porsche has become the latest Volkswagen subsidiary to become embroiled in the emissions scandal, after
Germany's Motor Transport Authority said it would test the company's Cayenne model. Porsche, however, refused to comment on the announcement, saying it had not yet been officially informed of it. The move came shortly after news magazine Der Spiegel reported that the Cayenne had emitted unusually high levels of nitrogen oxide in testing by certification authority TUV Nord. According to the magazine's information, the car is fitted with emissions-cheating software disguised as a "warm-up mode." Porsche told Der Spiegel the tests were "implausible" and said its own tests showed that the car was compliant with emissions standards. Until now Porsche has only been a small player in the 'Dieselgate' emissions scandal, which has cost Volkswagen billions of dollars in compensation and buy-backs. In Germany, Porsche's Macan SUV is part of a voluntary recall of 630 000 vehicles over which there are official doubts over
their emissions. There is no suggestion, however, that they have any illegal software fitted. Earlier in June German prosecutors announced they were expanding their investigation to Audi, which had previously been focused on vehicles in the United States. Authorities said Audi had installed equipment aimed at manipulating emissions tests in about 24 000 cars in
Germany and Europe. DPA  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
