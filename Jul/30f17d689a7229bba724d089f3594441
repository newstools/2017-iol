Johannesburg - Suzuki has extended the mechanical warranty on all its new passenger cars to five years and 200 000km. The longer warranty period - up from Suzuki’s standard three years or 100 000km promise - applies to cars sold from July to December 2017, and is included in the cost of the car. As sports fan and Suzuki SA divisional head for sales and marketing Andre Venter put it, that means the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo and the 2022 Soccer World Cup in Qatar will have come and gone before you need to worry about extending the warranty on your Suzuki. Venter says he has put time and effort into making the terms of the warranty as straightforward as possible. It will cover all costs in the case of a mechanical failure, he said, barring failures resulting from abuse, a lack of scheduled maintenance or a crash. He’s also arranged for the AA to extend its three-year roadside assistance programme for Suzuki customers to five years for the duration of the promotion - including help with changing a flat tyre, jump-starting a flat battery, car lock-out support, emergency fuel and even telephonic directions. Venter admits the six-month promotion is aimed at sweetening the pill of Suzuki SA’s recent one percent across-the-board price increase, but points out that it does have a real long-term benefit for the customer.
