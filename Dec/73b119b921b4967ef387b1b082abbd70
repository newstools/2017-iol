This stunning, massive sandstone rock formation in central Australia is a site to behold. Its official name is Uluru, but it's better known as Ayers Rock having been named so after Sir Henry Ayers (by William Gosse) in 1873 . The official name, Uluru, was derived from the indigenous Australians, who have been in the area for the last 10 000 years. Located in the southern part of the Northern Territory, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is believed to have been formed 600 million years ago. Stop #91 may have been in the beautiful town of Alice Spring's but the destination was located over 400km away at Ulruru. After a 12hr overnight bus trip to Alice, and sleepy recovery day, why not a 20hr return trip in 42 degrees to see the rock. It didn't disappoint! #southwalestonewsouthwales #cardifftocardiff #australia #northernterritory #backpacker #travelphotography #instatravel #instapic #travel #uluru #therock #alicesprings A post shared by Jason Brown (@jaysunbrowny) on Dec 13, 2017 at 5:12am PST According to uluru-australia.com, the mountain "originally sat at the bottom of a sea, but today stands 348m above ground. One of the most startling Uluru facts however, is that some 2.5kms of its bulk is underground." Around it, there are plenty of springs, waterholes and ancient  paintings. The Aboriginal people consider Uluru deeply sacred and are known to be against any climbing of the rock.
