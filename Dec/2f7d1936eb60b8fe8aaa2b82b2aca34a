JOHANNESBURG - Barloworld, the listed distribution group, is considering various options related to the group’s vehicle leasing assets as part of its previously announced strategic review.  The group said yesterday that it had significant capital allocated to leasing assets and it was considering various options to further optimise capital allocation into higher-returning opportunities.  It said the group believed that by funding these assets more effectively it would enhance its overall return on capital, while creating opportunities for the businesses directly or indirectly involved in leasing activities further capacity to pursue growth.  However, Barloworld said its board had not yet taken any decisions in this regard. Key initiatives that have been identified for the strategic review included fixing and addressing underperforming businesses, optimising returns from the existing portfolio, and looking at high-growth opportunities based on existing capabilities.  - BUSINESS REPORT
