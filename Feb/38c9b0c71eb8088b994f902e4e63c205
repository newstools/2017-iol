Idris Elba has been getting dating advice from children. The 44-year-old actor is currently auctioning off a Valentine’s Day (14.02.17) date with himself in order to raise money for the W.E Can Lead charity – which aims to provide support for schoolgirls in Africa – and has enlisted the help of young children to help teach him how to be the perfect gentleman. In a video posted by the Omaze YouTube channel, one young boy said: “It doesn’t matter about you, it matters about the girl.” Whilst one girl on the panel believed ‘The Dark Tower’ star should just be himself because his date might “like someone bad”. She told Idris in the video: “Because if you’re good, then you might have to wear glasses, suspenders, and ugly trousers. “And then your watch will be a babyish one, and then your date will probably slap you because she likes someone bad.” The news comes after it was revealed last month that the ‘Luther’ star would be giving one lucky fan the chance to spend an evening with the hunk in exchange for a donation to the charity. In a tongue-in-cheek video promoting the auction posted on his Facebook page, Idris gives some insight into what could be in store on the night. He says: "That's right, love. Just you and me. No one else around. Just us. Now, we'll get things started off with cocktails or perhaps champagne. And once we're feeling comfortable, we can order whatever your heart desires: Maybe some truffles, perhaps some steak, pepper soup and fufu. That's an African dish ... And for dessert, you can have whatever you want and I mean, whatever you want." Fans of Idris can sign up to donate for a chance to date the Hollywood heartthrob by visiting omaze.com/idris.
