US singer Beyonce, who gave birth to twins Sir and Rumi on 13 June, took to social media to congratulate first time mom, Serena. A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Sep 1, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT Serena previously revealed she is "looking forward" to motherhood and thinks having a baby will make her a "real woman". She shared: "I have so much respect for so many women [for giving birth]. I am about to be a real woman now, you know? It's going to be something incredibly impressive to go through ... I don't think watching birthing videos helps. I actually think it makes it worse. Having a baby, nothing is guaranteed."
