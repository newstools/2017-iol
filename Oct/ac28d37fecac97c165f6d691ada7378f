Johannesburg - Toyota South Africa has expanded its Fortuner and Hilux line-ups, the former getting a lower-priced 4x4 derivative and the latter gaining more automatic options, while both receive various specification enhancements. Previously, Fortuner buyers who wanted to go off-roading had to opt for a range-topping 2.8-litre GD-6 derivative, but now the 2.4 GD-6 is also available as a 4x4, paired with a six-speed automatic gearbox. As with the 2.8 models, the part-time four-wheel-drive system has low-range gearing for tackling steep obstacles. Engine outputs across the range remain as before, with the 2.4 GD-6 turbodiesel pushing 110kW and 400Nm and the 2.8 GD-6 turbodiesel producing 130kW and 420Nm (manual) or 450Nm (auto), while the normally aspirated 2.7-litre petrol model is rated at 122kW and 245Nm and the 4.0 V6 at 175kW/376Nm. Road test: New Fortuner's in a different league Toyota has upped the safety standard on the 2.4 GD-6 and 2.7 derivatives, which gain side and curtain airbags. Furthermore, the electrically-operated tailgate, which was previously only fitted to the 4.0 V6 model, is now also a standard feature on the 2.8 GD-6, and both also gain a 220V accessory connector and LED foglights. As before, the 2.8 and 4.0 Fortuners come with leather seats, auto climate control and LED headlights.

Single cab customers can now choose auto versions of the 2.4 GD-6 4x4 SRX and 2.8 GD-6 (4x2 or 4x4) Raider. In addition, various spec enhancements have been made across the Hilux range.
