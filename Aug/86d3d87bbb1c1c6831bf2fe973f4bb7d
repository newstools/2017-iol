Brussels, Belgium - The European Commission has announced that new car models will "have to pass new and more reliable emissions tests" before they can be driven on European roads. Diesel emissions are in particular focus after it emerged in 2015 that Volkswagen installed cheating mechanisms in many of its cars that make them appear less polluting than they actually are during emissions testing. The commission says the new tests "will ensure more reliable results and help to rebuild confidence in the performance of new cars". The tests are mandatory for all new car models from 1 September, and will be phased in between 2018 and 2019. Market surveillance EU commissioner Jyrki Katainen said: "The new emissions tests are a milestone in our ongoing work for cleaner and more sustainable cars over the coming years. "The emissions scandal has shown that we need more independence in car testing, stronger market surveillance and the possibility for the commission to intervene in case of wrongdoing." German magazine Der Spiegel reported in July that BMW, Audi, Porsche, Volkswagen and Daimler may have formed a cartel and met in secret working groups to discuss vehicle technology, costs, suppliers and emission control of diesel cars, while Daimler recalled more than three million Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Europe to make adjustments to their diesel engines.
