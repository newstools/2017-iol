LONDON – Zlatan Ibrahimovic is ready to talk about extending his stay at Manchester United after ruling out a move to the MLS. Ibrahimovic has begun a long road to recovery following his double cruciate ligament injury and has been rehabilitating at United’s AON training complex for the past 10 days. The 35-year-old is still considered an influential figure on the younger players at Old Trafford, even more so with Wayne Rooney poised to depart this summer, and agent Mino Raiola has revealed talks are planned soon with United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. “Will Ibrahimovic stay at Man United? I don’t know, we will speak soon,” said Raiola. “Many clubs have asked for Zlatan. He will play at least one more year, maybe even two years. “I’ll talk with the club and we’ll see what to do about the future. It’s still soon. These offers have come from a lot of different leagues, but he’ll stay in Europe.” United remain in competition with Chelsea for Everton’s Romelu Lukaku, but another option, Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata, has begun talks with AC Milan.
