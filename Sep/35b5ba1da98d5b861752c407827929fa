Ingredients 3 tbsp of oil, vegetable or sunflower 1 tsp small black mustard seeds, heaped 1 tsp cumin seeds, heaped 800 g of tinned chickpeas, undrained weight Frozen chopped spinach, 8 blocks ¾ tsp turmeric powder Salt, to taste 1½ tsp ground cumin, mixed with 1½ tsp of ground coriander Chilli powder, to taste 1 handful of fresh coriander, chopped Method Drain the chickpeas from the tins and set aside. Put the oil in a saucepan that will be large enough for all the chickpeas. Put it on a medium heat until the oil is hot. Test this by adding a few mustard seeds. If they fizzle and pop the oil is ready. Add the salt, chilli powder, coriander, cumin powder and turmeric powder and stir through with a fork. Add the blocks of chopped spinach and a few tablespoons of water and then cover the pan and leave on a medium heat for about 15 minutes. The spinach should then be soft. Turn the heat off, stir the spinach through and then serve hot with rice or bread. I like these mini seeded pitta breads.
