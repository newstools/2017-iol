Jennie Garth and her husband, Dave Abrams, are taking time apart but want to work on their marriage and have no plans to officially separate. The 45-year-old actress and the 36-year-old restaurateur - who tied the knot in July 2015 - are reportedly no longer living together, but they have not filed any legal paperwork to officially separate. A spokesperson for the former 'Beverly Hills, 90210' actress confirmed the pair are taking time apart but said they are working on their marriage. Jennie is said to be taking time out to focus on her daughters, Luca, 20, Lila, 14, and 11-year-old Fiona - who she has with ex-husband Peter Facinelli - but she and Dave are keen to get their marriage back on track. A source told Us Weekly magazine: "They are still trying to make it work, but they haven't been living together. They love each other, but like every marriage, it takes work. Jennie is taking the time to focus on her girls and herself." The news comes a week after the 'Mystery Girls' actress shared a cryptic quote about resilience and bouncing back from heartache on Instagram. She wrote: "Resilience means the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. But it doesn't mean we'll never experience sadness. "It proves we're able to spring back into shape after struggle has pushed us further than we ever imagined we could go. "Resilience allows us to overcome and bounce back from heartache stronger and more flexible than before. I am resilient You are resilient. Thank you @clarinarina for the love #life #grateful.(sic)" Jennie - who divorced Peter in 2013 - met her husband on a blind date in 2014 and they went on to tie the knot in a ceremony at her ranch in Los Olivos, California the following year.
