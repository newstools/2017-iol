INDIA - Bloomberg reports that India's Youth will be the World's Future by having the strongest workforce in the world. Half of India's population are millennials, under the age of 25 whereas two-thirds of the country's population is below the age of 35. India's workforce is expected to increase to a billion people between the ages of 16 and 54.   The workforce is expected to derive from North India where Uttar Pradesh has a fertility rate of nearly 3 whilst its neighbouring state, Bihar boasts a fertility rate of 3.3. Taking into account Bihar's already 100 million population, the state is expected to contribute generously to the establishment of a leading workforce. India's current demographic transition is occurring on a large scale. Compared to China's generation mainly in their 50's who have removed their country from poverty to middle-status income, India's population in their 20's are expected to do the same.
