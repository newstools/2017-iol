Gothenburg, Sweden – Volvo will partner with Google to build the Android operating system into its next generation of connected cars within the next two years, offering access to a wide array of new apps apps and services. The result is likely to be big changes in how Volvo customers interact with their cars, said Volvo research and development vice-president Henrik Geen, with a huge catalogue of Android apps, developed by Google, Volvo, or third party developers, offering connected and predictive services in and around the car. “Google's platform and services will enable more personalisation possibilities,” Green said, “while Android will offer increased flexibility from a development perspective." Green believes smart partnerships are the future for the car industry, reflecting the ongoing convergence between the automotive and technology industries as cars become increasingly connected. “Using Android as the base operating system will increase the speed and flexibility of development, said Patrick Brady, Vice President of Android Engineering at Google, “and enable customers to personalise their car’s connectivity the way they do with other devices.

Volvo and Google are also collaborating to update recent Volvo models by adding location-based service app Google Local Search; this will soon be released through an update to customers with Sensus Navigation. Google has promised more details on the partnership and ‘Android for Volvos’ at its annual technology expo, Google I/O, on 17 May. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
