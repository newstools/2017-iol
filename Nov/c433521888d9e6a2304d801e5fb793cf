Las Vegas, Nevada - Undoubtedly the stars of the Kia stand at the 2017 Specialty Equipment Market Association Show are two very different customs based on the all-new Stinger GT, Kia’s first performance sedan and its fastest car yet offered to the North American public. The first is a one-of-a-kind project by West Coast Customs of Burbank, California, inspired by the racing GT cars of the 1970s, with huge wheel-arch flares creating a distinctly narrow-waisted profile, while a carbon-fibre aero kit and rear diffuser, and quad tailpipes, add a touch of 21st-century bling.
 
The suspension has been lowered 35mm in front and 30mm at the rear, and the car runs on 21 inch Keen forged-alloy rims shod with high-performance rubber.
 
The Stinger GT Wide Body is finished in pearl blue metallic, echoed inside by handmade blue leather seat piping, a hand-stitched grey leather dashboard, gloss black centre console trim and a custom steering wheel trimmed in alcantara synthetic suede.  Stinger GT Federation
 
The second Stinger custom has been modified with parts and accessories from mainstream aftermarket suppliers, underlining the fact that this is the first time Kia has supplied development cars to the aftermarket ahead of time so that their go-fast goodies can hit the market at the same time as the model is launched - a common practice in Europe.
 
The point is that given money, tools and time, you could build build a Stinger just as sexy as this one, using parts and upgrades available off the shelf at your local go-fast specialist - or even online.
 
The Federation special starts with a K&N cold-air intake and a free-flowing Borla four-piper exhaust system, boosting the Stinger’s 3.3-litre twin-turbo V6 from 268kW to an estimated 280kW. 
 
Eibach springs, thicker anti-roll bars and lowering kit combine with staggered 20 inch TSW rims and Falken low-profile rubber to provide the serious ‘stance’ street cred.
 
Finally, a rear spoiler, diffuser and custom bonnet vents from Air Design USA provide an edgy contrast to a creamy-orange custom spray job. IOL Motoring
