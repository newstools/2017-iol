  Gothenburg, Sweden – As the car market gets tougher, all motor manufacturers are looking for new demographics to target, especially at entry level, to woo new customers to their brand. But this limited-edition model really takes that idea to its logical conclusion. It’s targeted at drivers between one and three years old. This is the Volvo Rider, a kids’ ride-on car styled to mimic the current Volvo design language, with big wheels for stability and a big steering wheel for easy driving in tiny hands. It comes in either fashionable metallic silver or crash-test orange, complete with authentic quadrant markings, working LED head and tail-lights (with 10 minute delay function) and a working hooter. The only thing that’s not kid-friendly is the price – €166.10 (R2440) from the Volvo Lifestyle collection. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
