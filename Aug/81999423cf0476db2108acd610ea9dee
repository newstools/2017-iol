The dark colour and sweet flavours of this seven year old rum is perfect for this cocktail. The classic spicy notes are all there in your 7 Presidente and the orange bitters ensure that the sweetness is not to overpowering. Rum is the must have cocktail this summer so it's also the perfect time to experiment with the spirit and with flavours that you might not think make for a goof cocktail. But this 7 Presidente is the perfect serve because the sugar syrup will make sure that even those who turn their nose up at rum will take one sip and quickly realise that rum is worthy of all the praise this summer time. Be adventurous, these are also the best ingredients for a rum punch if you want everyone to enjoy the spirit of rum.
