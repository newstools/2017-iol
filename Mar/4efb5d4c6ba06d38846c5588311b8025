National Prosecuting Authority spokeswoman Natasha Kara confirmed that the 29- year-old appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court this week, saying the matter has been remanded while he undergoes a mental assessment. “He will be sent to a district surgeon. Then it is likely that a bed will be booked at Fort Napier for him to undergo 30 days' observation,” said Kara. The vicious killing of Scott, 54, who was well-known in horse-racing circles, left her family reeling and sent shockwaves through the racing fraternity in Shongweni. Gregorowski was arrested at the scene and during his bail hearing gave details about the events which took place during the night before and the early hours of the morning prior to Scott’s death. He subsequently abandoned his bail application. Following the murder, Scott’s brother Rob said his sister had been so badly beaten he could only recognise her by the tattoos on her stomach.
