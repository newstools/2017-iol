Orlando Pirates gained revenge on Free State Stars with an emphatic 4-1 victory in the Nedbank Cup last-16 at the James Motlatsi Stadium in Orkney on Saturday night. The Buccaneers were beaten 3-2 by Ea Lla Koto last week in the Absa Premiership, and have been low on confidence under new coach Kjell Jonevret in recent weeks. But they were dominant throughout, and Mpho Makola – later voted the Man of the Match – opened the scoring in the 20th minute with a long-range effort that beat Stars goalkeeper Christopher Mafoumbi. But the home side hit back before halftime when Sifiso Mbhele headed the ball past Pirates shot-stopper Siyabonga Mpontshane. Disaster struck after the break, though, when Stars defender Joseph Okumu scored an own goal to put Pirates in front once more. The visitors turned on the charm and Oupa Manyisa pounced to produce a third in the 63rd minute. Pirates finished things off in style as winger Thembinkosi Lorch curled the ball into the net in stoppage time to send his team through to the quarter-finals.
