NBA Vice President and Managing Director Amadou Gallo Fall was chosen as the first recipient of the African Leader in Sport Development Award at the inaugural African Leaders 4 Change Awards event on Tuesday night. The awards ceremony took place at the Sandton Convention Centre. Gallo Fall said the NBA are determined to ensure that the “Africa Rising narrative” doesn’t just remain a “romantic dream”, and that he hopes that the sport of basketball can make a significant difference in the lives of young people. The African Leaders 4 Change Awards recognises individuals and organisations in the philanthropy field. “We moved here in 2010 to open the NBA office in Johannesburg, working across the continent. Our strategy to grow the game of basketball is underpinned by our commitment to making sure we use our sport and the values of the game, which teach young people to be self-reliant, confident, have respect, to learn leadership skills and teamwork,” Gallo Fall said. “That’s what we are going to need if we are going to make sure that the whole Africa Rising narrative does not just remain a romantic dream. “We have to make sure we equip our young people with those life skills that they will carry forward, and build the Africa that we all deserve to see.” IOL Sport
