JOHANNESBURG – Tsepo Masilela has warned that Kaizer Chiefs cannot afford to take Lamontville Golden Arrows lightly, if they are going to come out with maximum points against them at FNB Stadium this Saturday (Kick-off 8.15pm). Failure to do so, the Kaizer Chiefs veteran defender warned, might tamper with their aspirations of finishing higher than they did in their previous league campaign.  Chiefs are currently fourth on the PSL standings with 46 points from 26 league outings, while Abafana Bestehende are 9th with 31 points from the same number of matches. “We are not in a good position as it stands,” Masilela said. “The ones who are in a good position are the ones who are on top of the league standings.   “But we intend to give it our best in the remaining last four matches and hope for the best. We don’t have much control with regards to what happens in other teams. However, we can only focus on ourselves and try our utmost best to finish in a good position. “Everybody is fighting for points at this stage of the season,” Masilela added. “There are teams who are fighting to stay away from the relegation zone, there are teams fighting to finish high up on the league standings and there are also teams who are fighting to win the league title as well. “We are expecting a tough encounter from Arrows as well. They are decent team. They didn’t reach the semi-finals of the Nedbank Cup by mere luck. But for us, it’s more about finishing in a better position than we did last season. We have to do better that we did in our previous league encounters.” Independent Media   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
