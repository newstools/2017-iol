The body of local chartered accountant, Werner Hauptfleisch, was discovered early on Monday morning, in Nooitgedacht Street, Kimberley. The director of PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed to the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) Board in June 2014, where he served as president of the Central Region Council. He was also a director on The Hope Factory and previously served as a director on the Thuthuka Education Upliftment Fund. Hauptfleisch is survived by his wife and two children. He was 46-years-old. Police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi, on Monday confirmed the incident, adding that his death was the subject of an investigation. “An inquest has been registered at Kimberley police station following the discovery of the body of a 46-year-old man,” she said. “It appears as if his body was discovered by his domestic worker in his backyard." “At this stage no foul play is suspected." “The police investigation continues.” The CEO of the Northern Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Nocci), Sharon Steyn, said that the news came as a massive shock, adding that his death was a major loss for the local business community, describing Hauptfleisch as a true “person of Kimberley”. “Werner was extremely active in local business circles and the community in general,” Steyn said on Monday. “I can not comment on the specifics of what happened but the news came as a shock to many in the city as he was very well-known and liked throughout Kimberley." Apart from working for PricewaterhouseCoopers, Werner served on various committees and was also an avid cyclist. “He was always willing to go the extra mile to help wherever he saw a need and is going to be sorely missed." “Nobody expected something like this to happen and our condolences go out to his friends and family.” Diamond Fields Advertiser
