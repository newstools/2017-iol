Johannesburg - Sebastian Vettel, it would seem, is not alone, although the consequences for the driver of this Ferrari 488 were a lot more severe. Social media in Gauteng were buzzing over the weekend after the Ferrari was involved in a collision with a Mazda CX3 at an intersection in Sandton, writing off both cars, luckily without serious injury to any of the occupants. Onboard video from the Ferrari clearly shows it approaching a green traffic light, when the Mazda turns into its path, and a rather amateur attempt at avoidance brings the two violently together in the middle of the intersection - very violently indeed, if the damage to the Italian supercar is anything to go by.
