There are certain items that one should never pack in the luggage: Toiletries You are probably think I am crazy to even to suggest this, but the truth is that many of us pack toiletries that we don’t even end up using. Many travellers often take big bottles of lotion and shampoos despite it being a complimentary benefit during a hotel stay. Try to pack the bare essentials like deodorants and sunscreen. Snacks and food I have heard of travellers who carry containers of food in cooler boxes because they want to have a home meal while at their holiday destination.  Others smuggle in their favourite snacks and food. While it's hard to resist a bar of chocolate or a box of rusks, try to leave food items at home. Part of travelling to a new place is about exploring the tastes and smells of that destination. Valuables  A lot of travellers carry unwanted gadgets and other unnecessary items that end up being kept in their bags or the safe of a hotel. Most hotels have laptops and desktops that guests can use during their stay. Iron I know this may sound weird, but some travellers carry an iron in their luggage in fear that they would not get the appliance at their hotel or resort. Try to iron your clothes before you pack them. This not only saves time, but also helps when an iron may not be available. Restricted items Many people get arrested because they fail to comply to airline policies. Try to not carry harmful substances, like drugs or illegal medication,  weapons or any other restricted item on board. Towels 
Carrying towels just takes up space in your bag. Most accommodation venues provide towels as part of their packages.
