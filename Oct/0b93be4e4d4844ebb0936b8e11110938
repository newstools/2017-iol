DURBAN - The MTN8 final between Cape Town City and SuperSport United will take place at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday as scheduled despite the heavy rains and floods that hit Durban on Tuesday. While the downpour that left many cars under water on the city's highways forced the Premier Soccer League to cancel the press conference to announce both the player and coach of the month winners, the league said there was no chance of them shifting the season-opening final from the iconic World Cup arena. “We are not worried at all. There’s a good weather forecast predicted for Saturday. We still have plenty of time. (On Monday) there were storms in Johannesburg but there’s sunshine (now)," PSL spokesman Luxolo September said, urging fans to go to the match. "People must come in their numbers on Saturday. We are expecting good football from these two sides and there’s going to be a lot of entertainment.” The weather beareau confirmed September's prediction of good weekend weather. Julius Mahlangu who works at the South African Weather Service in Durban said they were not expecting any heavy rains for the weekend. “There are slight chances of rain estimated for Saturday. But in general, the weather will fine and nice during the day and it will be part cloudy in the after. "There’s 30% chance of rain and thundershowers for Saturday night which I don’t think will have an effect on the match,” Mahlangu elaborated. SuperSport are looking to capture their first MTN8 crown in 13 years. The last time they lifted the trophy was back in 2004 under coach Pitso Mosimane when the trophy was still called the SAA Supa8 at Durban's Kings Park. On the other hand, their adversaries City have coach Benni McCarthy looking for his first piece of silverware as coach. Adding intrigue to the match is the fact that SuperSport coach Eric Tinkler was in charge of City last season. It's the kind of match that shouldn't be spoilt by rain.
