BEIJING - Chinese authorities have
recouped 730 million yuan ($112.20 million) in misappropriated
funds as part of an investigation into the country's national
poverty-reduction scheme, the official Xinhua news agency
reported on Saturday. Nearly 450 people have been charged for offenses relating to
the misused funds in an inspection of 28 provinces, said Xinhua,
citing the Ministry of Finance and the State Council Leading
Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development. The report gave no details on how the funds were misused. China's government has pledged to wipe out poverty by 2020,
targeting 70 million people living below the poverty line, but
researchers and social workers say a lasting solution will take
much longer. Read: 4 apps that can track your lost phone China has spent 196.1 billion yuan ($30.14 billion) on
poverty relief over the past four years, said Xinhua. Earlier this month, Hu Zejun, the head of the National Audit
Office, said that the country has punished a total of 970 people
for misusing the funds under the same programme. It was not
clear whether that number included the 450 people charged for
offenses. Hu said 101,800 people had been removed from the government
list of registered poor while another 95,000 were added. Beijing committed 86 billion yuan ($13.22 billion) to
poverty alleviation in 2017 under the national programme, most
of which is used for infrastructure projects, as well as
subsidies for education and health care.
