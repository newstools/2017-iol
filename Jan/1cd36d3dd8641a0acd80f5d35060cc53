Lagos - Fitch Ratings revised the outlook on Nigeria to negative from stable over concerns that a lack of foreign exchange will hamper the economy, and affirmed the West African nation s rating at B+, four steps below investment grade.While Nigeria s economy will probably expand at 1.5 percent this year, after contracting by an estimated 1.5 percent in 2016, the non-oil industry will continue to be constrained by foreign-currency shortages, the ratings company said on Wednesday. Access to foreign exchange will remain severely restricted until the Central Bank of Nigeria can establish the credibility of the interbank foreign-exchange market and bring down the spread between the official rate and the parallel market rates, Fitch said. Trading volumes remain low. They were $8.4billion (R111.88 billion) in December, compared with $24 billion in December 2014, according to Fitch.While government debt remains low at 17 percent of gross domestic product, the shortage of state revenue poses a risk to debt sustainability , according to Fitch.
