Gothenburg, Sweden – Volvo has announced that its Polestar performance division is set to become a standalone high-performance electric car brand. With this move, Volvo will be hoping to gain a foothold into the premium battery car market currently dominated by Tesla. These new cars won’t wear any Volvo badges, although they will still share technologies with their parent brand. Volvo has yet to go into any detail about the new Polestar products that are on the horizon, but the company is promising that these newcomers will be “world-beaters”. “Polestar will be a credible competitor in the emerging global market for high performance electrified cars,” said Volvo Cars president Håkan Samuelsson. “With Polestar, we are able to offer electrified cars to the world’s most demanding, progressive drivers in all market segments.” The new Polestar division will be headed up by Thomas Ingenlath. Previously serving as Volvo’s senior vice president of design, Ingenlath is said to be the inspiration behind Volvo’s recent design renaissance. All hail the electric revolution!
