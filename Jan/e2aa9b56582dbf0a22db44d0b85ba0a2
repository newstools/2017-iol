Cape Town The Cape Argus has evolved over its 160-year history, according to Independent Media executive chairman Dr Iqbal Surv&eacute;, who says the newspaper, which celebrates its birthday this week, is more solutions-driven than in the past. In many ways, the Argus is the same but not the same. It s the same in that the news is still great, the content is superb, but it s more solutions-driven. These days you are reading more and more articles about various things that help people. He is looking forward to the Cape Argus fulfilling Independent Media s vision of being part of your past, shaping your future . He said the newspaper, especially its sports pages, helped drive transformation. In the past, even though there might have been very outstanding sportsmen and women that were black, they were always hidden away in terms of exposure. So, it is nice to see that kind of change. There were also more letters and comments being sent in from townships and on the Cape Flats, he said. I love what the editors in Cape Town in general are doing in terms of bringing the newspapers to the communities. Surv&eacute; noted #TheDignityProject and the #ShutItDown editions, which showed the newspaper was socially conscious over issues of the marginalised in society.Cape Argus
