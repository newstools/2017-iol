Kevin Spacey is seeking "evaluation and treatment" following allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual assault. The 'House of Cards' actor is "taking the time necessary" to "seek evaluation and treatment" after actor Anthony Rapp claimed Kevin made a sexual advance towards him when he was just 14 years old in 1986. In a statement, Kevin's representative said: "Kevin Spacey is taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment. No other information is available at this time." Since Rapp spoke out, an unnamed man says he was left "traumatised" as a teenager when he allegedly woke up to find Kevin Spacey lying on him whilst a number of other men have accused the Hollywood actor of sexual assault. Kevin had previously apologised to Anthony, where he admitted he was "beyond horrified" to hear the claims but insisted he couldn't remember the alleged "encounter". In a statement, he said: "I have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I'm beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. "But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he described having carried with him all these years." Since the allegations became public, Kevin was stripped of his 2017 International Emmy Founders Award, which he was going to receive for being "one of the great multi-dimensional talents". The International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences said in a statement: "The International Academy has announced today that in light of recent events it will not honour Kevin Spacey with the 2017 International Emmy Founders Award." Production on 'House of Cards' sixth and final season has also been suspended indefinitely in the wake of the allegations.
