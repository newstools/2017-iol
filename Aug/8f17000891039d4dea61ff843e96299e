Isuzu’s UK division has unleashed a new version of its high-riding AT35 beast, which was developed in conjunction with Arctic Trucks. Based on the UK-spec D-Max (called the KB in SA), the AT35 gets a lift kit that raises the body by 30mm, and filling those boldly flared wheel arches is a set of black 17-incha alloy wheels wearing 35-inch Nokian Rotiiva all-terrarin tyres. This Isuzu was engineered for the most gruelling of conditions, but it’s not trying to be a Raptor beater in any sense, as power comes from a new 1.9-litre turbodiesel engine, rated at 121kW and 360Nm. It’s available in the UK as a double cab only, and buyers do get all the latest creature comforts inside the cabin, including a 17.78cm touchscreen infotainment system that’s compatible with CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as satnav and diamond-stitched leather seats with ‘Arctic Trucks’ embroidery. At this stage there’s no word on whether Isuzu South Africa will offer the AT35 or anything like it in South Africa, but it certainly would be a good way to kick off the company’s new local era. Isuzu recently announced its intention to purchase GM’s Struandale plant in Port Elizabeth, as well as the latter’s 30 percent share in Isuzu’s local truck business. The company recently announced that operations at the local factory had been consolidated to produce only the Isuzu KB range, and the company has sent production managers to the assembly line to ensure that quality had not been compromised during the reorganisation process.
