 A FOREST fire near a Spanish national park saw more than 2,000 people evacuated yesterday, including tourists in hotels and campsites. Hundreds of firefighters were battling the blaze as it threatened to destroy Donana National Park, a Unesco World Heritage site near Huelva in south-west Spain, but were hampered by strong winds fanning the flames. The fire began on Saturday night and officials are blaming it on either human negligence or arson. It comes after forest fires in Portugal last weekend killed more than 60 people.
