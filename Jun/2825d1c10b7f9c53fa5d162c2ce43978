Popular guest speaker and renowned horticulturalist Geoff Nichols will be presenting a talk at Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh (Kwa Zulu-Natal South Coast) on 8 July. Nichols will focus his talk on Wetlands in KZN.  “My talk will be a ramble through the wetlands both wild and illusionary (human constructed) in my travels for work and pleasure. I will touch on why we have to conserve and manage our sponges in this country. It is not a technical talk, but rather a fun visit to places that when walking through them, you get your feet wet," commented Nichols.  Nichols has diplomas in agriculture, horticulture, and parks and recreation administration, all of which came in useful during the 21 years he spent working for the Durban Parks Department. He specialises particularly in indigenous gardening, and pioneered the cultivation of indigenous medicinal plants at the Silverglen Medicinal Plant Nursery. In 1996, Nichols set up his own horticultural consultancy, and has published several books on a variety of topics, including plant propagation, medicinal plants, and wild gardening.  “Nichols is an amazing guest speaker and is incredibly knowledgeable. This talk will be a fascinating one - that’s for sure,” commented Martin Rodrigues, General Manager: Crocworld Conservation Centre.  Tickets for the talk will cost R75 per adult and R35 for pensioners. Tickets will entitle guests to complimentary teas and coffees, as well as access to the Crocworld Conservation Centre’s vast grounds, Izinyoni Indigenous Nursery and the Le- Rendez- Vous restaurant.
