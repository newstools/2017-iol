New Cape Town City coach Benni McCarthy revealed there will be a few surprises when he names his first-ever starting team to take on Polokwane City in a MTN8 quarter-final at the Cape Town Stadium on Saturday afternoon (3pm). At the same time, McCarthy was also frank about his emotions, admitting that he is “nervous as hell” as he counts down the days to his debut as a head coach of a football team. Speaking to the media after City had finished training in Green Point on Tuesday, McCarthy said: “I have my starting team in mind. I have a fit squad (except for the injured Aubrey Ngoma and Judas Moseamedi), and just choosing the 18 for Saturday will be tough. “I’ve had a good few weeks training the team and I have a decent relationship with the players. What I can say is that the starting team is going to be a surprise to most people.” While the butterflies continue to flutter inside of McCarthy, as the nervousness of his first game approaches, he had high praise for his squad. “This is a massive step for me,” said the former Bafana Bafana striker. “But let me tell you that I couldn’t have gone into battle for my first game with a better bunch of guys. They’ve made my job easy – there are no egos in this squad, and they have been disciplined and professional throughout. “I’m really looking forward to Saturday. And so, too, are the players, as they are determined to prove that they aren’t one-season wonders. “They want to replicate the success of last season, and that means I can rely on their desire and motivation to carry us against Polokwane on Saturday.” @Reinerss11  IOL Sport  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
