London - Britain will hold a public
inquiry into contaminated blood supplied to patients in the
state-run National Health Service which killed at least 2 400
people, the government said on Tuesday. During the 1970s and 1980s, blood products supplied to the
NHS was contaminated with viruses such as HIV or hepatitis C and
infected thousands of people with haemophilia or other bleeding
disorders. Health minister Philip Dunne said many documents were
publicly available which gave a comprehensive picture of events
and decisions made at the time. "However, I recognise for those affected these steps do not
go far enough to provide the answers that they want to get to
the truth of what happened," he told parliament. "In light of these concerns and a report of new evidence and
allegations of potential criminality, we think it is important
to understand the extent of what is claimed and the wider issues
that arise." Families of victims will be consulted to decide what form
the inquiry would take. A report by lawmakers in 2015 said the Department of Health
estimated that more than 30,000 people might have been infected
with hepatitis C between 1970 and 1991 when Britain imported
some blood products from the United States but just 6,000 had
been identified. A further 1,500 were infected with HIV between 1978 and
1985. The inquiry comes after leaders from all of Britain's main
political parties, except the ruling Conservatives, wrote a
joint letter to May demanding an investigation into the issue. "For decades people with bleeding disorders and their
families have sought the truth," said Liz Carroll, Chief
Executive of The Haemophilia Society. "Instead, they were told by the government that no mistakes
were made while it repeatedly refused to acknowledge evidence of
negligence and a subsequent cover up. Finally, they will have
the chance to see justice." Reuters
