Take anyone to Cape Town and they will probably fall in love with the city, and American talk show host and comedian Chelsea Handler is no different. Handler, who is famous for movies Fun Size and This Means War, has been exploring the city and doing some charity while in South Africa. She joined Charlize Theron and Trevor Noah at Oaklands High School in Landsdowne on Monday where the celeb trio interacted with the students and learned some lessons in the classroom. Her other Cape Town fun activities included taking a ride off the coast of Cape Town in search of sharks, hiking up Lion's Head with her cousin and visiting Seal Island where she gave a moving tribute to her late dog Tammy. The Chelsea host seems to be enjoying her stay- posting about her experience on Lions Head. While she mentioned she hates hiking, it seems the iconic Cape Town site changed her mind. She said in the post: “ Got moving today when I needed to remind myself that you do no good sitting around and getting angrier. I f**** hate hiking. I don't anymore. #lionshead #capetown” In another, she described how everyone though she and her cousin were a couple and were getting engaged. Here are some of her Instagram posts:
