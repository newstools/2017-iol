The problem with the original Clio GT-Line that was introduced two years back is that its 66kW 0.9-litre engine, despite being turbo-charged, simply couldn’t cash the cheques that this racy-looking derivative’s styling kit was writing. That’s about to change however, with the release of the facelifted GT-Line model, which joins the updated Clio line-up that hit our shores in November last year. While it’s not about to launch itself into hot hatch territory, the new GT-Line does at least promise warmish performance, courtesy of the 88kW/205Nm 1.2-litre four-cylinder turbopetrol engine that was previously only available in the Expression EDC model. The engine is mated to a six-speed manual transmission and Renault claims a 9.0-second 0-100km/h sprint time and 199km/h top speed, which is pretty good performance for the R264 900 asking price. The GT-Line always looked the part and the latest one gets with the latest Clio facelift programme, while still standing apart with its own styling kit. This comes in the form of a unique front bumper as well as 17-inch titanium grey allows with matching exterior mirrors, side strips and rear diffuser. The model has a design flavour of its own on the inside too, thanks to a set of sport front seats with unique upholstery, GT-Line embossed headrests and an RS-style leather steering wheel and gear knob. Standard kit includes a 17.8cm MediaNav touch-screen infotainment system with satnav, cruise control, auto lights and wipers, rear park distance control, air conditioning and electric windows front and rear. As with the rest of the Clio range, the GT-Line is sold with a three-year/45 000km service plan and five-year/150 000 warranty.
