Johannesburg President Jacob Zuma on Wednesday, wished ailing gospel singer, Lundi Tyamara who is fighting for his life in hospital, a speedy recovery. Tyamara, one of South Africa's most talented gospel artists and a multi-award winner, has been hospitalised since December, and was battling abdominal tuberculosis (TB) and a liver condition. &quot;Zuma has urged South Africans to keep Tyamara and his family in their thoughts and prayers,&quot; said the presidency in a statement. Meanwhile, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) on Tuesday also called for prayers. &quot;We call on all to join in prayer and intercede for his speedy recovery and in the same way that Lundi Tyamara s music has carries millions of us through difficult times, we call on all to also carry him in this difficult time,&quot; EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said at the time. &quot;He is a great gift to gospel music in this country and we believe he still has more to give.&quot; Messages of support and well wishes have been posted on social media since Tuesday, and #LetsPrayForLundi was a trending on Twitter in South Africa.
