CAPE TOWN – After becoming African champions, and signing Oupa Manyisa and George Lebese, you’d think Mamelodi Sundowns already have a team to conquer South Africa and the continent. But Pitso Mosimane is determined to defend the Caf Champions League title, as well as reclaim the Premiership crown from Wits. So the former Bafana Bafana mentor went into the market once more on Thursday and picked up striker Thokozani Sekotlong on a five-year deal. The 26-year-old Sekotlong was a free agent after his Free State Stars contract came to an end and he decided not to remain in Bethlehem. His arrival at Chloorkop could be seen as a back-up for Zimbabwean star Khama Billiat, who has refused to sign a new contract. Mosimane, though, has made it clear that he is chasing the signature of SuperSport United marksman Jeremy Brockie as a prime finisher as a replacement for Billiat. It is a homecoming for Sekotlong, who is the third player from Mamelodi to join the Brazilians in the current transfer window after Lebese and Lucky Mohomi. “Joining Mamelodi Sundowns is a dream come true for me because I have supported this team all my life, so does my family,” Sekotlong told the Sundowns website on Thursday. “I hope I can add to the success of the team and also score more goals.”   Masandawana will take on SuperSport United in their PSL opener at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville on Saturday (3pm kickoff). @ashfakmohamed  IOL Sport  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
