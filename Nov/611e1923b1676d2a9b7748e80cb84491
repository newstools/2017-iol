The annual Elgin Open Gardens show is held over 28-29 October and 4-5 November, 2017. This year, the show features 18 open gardens in the Elgin and Bot River districts. These range from large established country gardens (some over 50 years old), to young, recently planted gardens in villages and on smallholdings. It is occasion where all of one’s senses are heightened by the beauty of nature- see, smell and touch a variety of colours, scents and textures. The crippling drought which is gripping the region does not seem to have had too much impact on the quality, variety and abundance of flowers , shrubs ,trees and grasses on display. \  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

At times one could believe you are in the middle of an English countryside estate, whilst literally down the road, the traditional fynbos gardens remind you of the special and unique beauty of our very own indigenous plant kingdom. And speaking of diversity, this is not a show for only the dedicated plant enthusiasts - it is a chance for young and old to spend a day with nature in all its glory, less than an hour from the city. Children delight at the chance to run and explore the pathways and avenues between the flower beds and trees, while the adults test one another’s expertise [or otherwise] around identities of the myriad of plant species they encounter. And there is every opportunity to satisfy any hunger pangs, with choices to tempt and delight the taste buds. From simply elegant tea gardens, to stylish eateries on wine estates, the choice is yours. The Elgin Open Gardens 2017 – an event for everyone,   which should not be missed
