Jessica Biel’s house is “covered” in mess now that her son is two years old. The 35-year-old actress has her son Silas with her husband Justin Timberlake, and has revealed that since the tot entered the “terrible twos” in April, she is finding their family home to be more and more messy. During an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert the show host asked how many of her surfaces had been dirtied by Silas, and Jessica said: “Every square inch. And if it’s not the hopeful chocolate, it’s stickers, and Play-Doh, and Gak, and crumbs and who knows. Everything is covered with everything.” And The Sinner star is relieved when her son finally goes to sleep, and finds herself becoming angry when anyone disturbs him from his slumber. She said: “God forbid they wake up in the middle of the night. You know, if you wake my kid up in the middle of the night by accident, you’re dead to me.”     She added: “That’s right. Not my friends. My friends are quiet, demure, modest. He’s a wild musician.” However, it’s not just the “terrible twos” stage that Jessica and Justin have to worry about, as she’s equally as cautious for Silas’ next birthday, when he turns into a “three-teen”. She bemoaned: “This is terrible, but I’ve heard so much about the ‘three-teens.’ The 3-year-olds are called the ‘three-teens’ because they’re so insane that they’re just like having tiny teenagers, which is way worse than having big teenagers, I think.”
