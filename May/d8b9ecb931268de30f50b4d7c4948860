The SANZAAR Foul Play Review Committee has accepted a guilty plea from Shaun Treeby of the Stormers for contravening Law 10.4(e) Dangerous tackling of an Opponent, after he was cited during a Super Rugby match at the weekend. Treeby has been suspended from all forms of the game for three weeks, up to and including Saturday 10 June 2017. The incident occurred in the 46th minute of the match between the Stormers and Blues played at Newlands on Friday, when Treeby brought down Blues flyhalf Piers Francis around the neck, which saw Francis leave the field injured. The SANZAAR Committee of Nigel Hampton QC (Chairman), Stefan Terblanche and Stephen Hardy assessed the case. In his finding, chairman Hampton ruled the following: “Having conducted a detailed review of all the available evidence, including all camera angles and additional evidence, as well as an explanation from the player and submissions from his legal representative, Thembelani Mayosi, the Foul Play Review Committee upheld the citing under Law 10.4(e). “With respect to sanction, the Foul Play Review Committee deemed the act of foul play merited a mid-range entry point of six weeks. “However, taking into account mitigating factors, including the player’s excellent judicial record over a long professional career and his early guilty plea, the committee reduced the suspension to three weeks.” SANZAAR   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
