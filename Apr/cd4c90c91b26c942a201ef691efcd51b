Are you in Johannesburg on May 7 and want to do something exciting? Why not head out to the Ngwenya Country Market in Muldersdrift. People from all over Johannesburg and some tourists attend the market that takes places on the first Sunday of each month. Set in the Ngwenya Glass Village amid lovely gardens, a brewery and restaurants, the market attracts hundreds of people who visit to sample their food and craft offerings.  The idea of the market came from friends Viv Prettejohn and Tina Berti in August last year. They wanted to get more people socialising and showcase local business offerings. In May, they will introduce new vendors, including the  Prickly Pear stall that offers a taste of Mexico and Greece , The Raw Food Wizard showcasing vegan indulgences and for dog lovers Jimmy Chew is one stall not to miss. “Ngwenya Country Market offer a range of arts, crafts, live music and merchandise in a unique environment.
