 Since more people are aware of the risk of over exposure to skin damaging sun rays, it’s not surprising that many women are turning  to the bottle  ... to top up their tan. But it seems they’re not alone in wanting a golden glow. Rising numbers of men are deciding to fake it, too. One in seven admit using self-tan, with the proportion rising to one in three among men aged 16 to 24. They could be inspired by reality TV stars such as Mark Wright, 29, who admitted fake tanning ahead of his appearance on Strictly Come Dancing. Research by retail analysts Mintel found the proportion of men using the products at home rose from one in ten in 2015 to one in seven last year. Among men aged 16 to 24, the proportion doubled from one in six to one in three. The figures even suggested young men could be overtaking women in their love of bronzing. One in four visited a tanning salon in 2016, compared to only one in five women of the same age group. The research also found gradual tanning lotions – which  provide a gentle transition from pasty to bronzed when applied daily – were used by 12 per cent of men, up from 7 per cent the previous year. Over the same period, the proportion of men using oral tanning supplements rose from 6 per cent to 11 per cent. Roshida Khanom, senior beauty and personal care analyst at Mintel,  said: ‘Today’s men are reflecting on their image and responsibilities and how to express their masculinity. With younger men focusing on their appearance more, the self-tanning sector could see a boost.’ Warnings about too much sun exposure have also helped fake tan’s popularity. Mintel said more than half of Britons now use sun creams which provide a high level of protection, up from 45 per cent in 2015.  © Daily Mail
