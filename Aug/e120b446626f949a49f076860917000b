Triumph UK and Triumph South Africa have parted ways, and the British motorcycles will no longer be imported by Kawasaki Motorcycles SA (KMSA). Triumph UK is in the process of appointing a new SA importer within the next six months or so, during which time KMSA will continue to support the brand with spares, accessories and warranties. Arnold Olivier, Brand Director of Triumph South Africa, says the split occurred over Triumph UK’s new retail concept that calls for single, larger dealerships in cities rather than the present model of using a number of smaller dealers. The alternative of upgrading the existing smaller stores would have required a very high financial investment, and the new distributor will clearly need to have deep pockets to meet Triumph UK’s new customer-interface model. KMSA has been SA’s Triumph distributor for 22 years and is the world’s third largest independent Triumph importer. The 115-year old brand has a strong following in this country with around 4 500 Triumphs on our roads. The Triumph Thruxton R is also South Africa’s reigning Pirelli Bike of the Year as voted for by a panel of motorcycle journalists. Triumph Motorcycles Ltd is the largest British motorcycle manufacturer, established in 1984 by John Bloor after the original company Triumph Engineering went into receivership. The new company continued Triumph's record of motorcycle production since 1902. If you’re looking for a  biking bargain, now would be a good time to buy a Triumph as KMSA is selling off existing stock at drastically reduced prices.
