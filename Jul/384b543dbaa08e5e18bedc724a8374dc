Rustenburg - The Democratic Alliance walked out of council meeting in Tswaing to protest against the appointment of Manoto Isaac Moruti as the new municipal manager, the party said on Thursday. "Mr Moruti is a former Chief Financial Officer [CFO] in Tswaing who got suspended from this position due to financial irregularities. Under his tenure as CFO, the municipality was put under administration and received several disclaimer reports from the Auditor-General," said caucus leader Carin Visser. She said upon leaving Tswaing, Moruti was appointed as a municipal manager in Ventersdorp, where the Auditor-General asked the Public Protector to investigate maladministration and tender irregularities that he might be linked to. "Mr Moruti’s track record disqualifies him from holding any senior position in Tswaing or for any other municipality." She said when the DA walked out of council in protest, other opposition parties followed them. African News Agency  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
