While we are suffering in the midst of a cold snap that has literally captured the country, we saw some of our favourite personalities living it up in other parts of the world. From exploring technology haven Japan to sun bathing in Croatia, these personalities were living their best life! This week Maps Maponyane shared images of his rain-filled Japan travel and yummy mummy Johanna Mukoki nearly broke the internet with pics of her in a bikini in Croatia. Johanna Mukoki  This city #dubrovnik is full of so many historical buildings. You will be surprised how many tourists flock into most visited cities around the world because of their historical architecture. It's one of the things that saddens me when I drive through downtown Johannesburg and see even our city library burnt down.. #SouthAfrica_rise #BeInspired  #summer_holiday 👙 #family_first💕 A post shared by Johanna Mukoki (@johannamukoki) on Aug 17, 2017 at 4:34am PDT Then the image that had all of us looking for our running shoes surfaced... #Happy_friday: In this heat, we are spending the day at the poolside and in the Adriatic sea today. Thank you @thalgo.sa for making me poolside ready 😍 #turn_your_happy_on 😃 #BeInspired  #summer_holiday 👙 #family_first 💕 A post shared by Johanna Mukoki (@johannamukoki) on Aug 18, 2017 at 1:59am PDT All we can say, is slay! Mukoki is enjoying the sunshine on a family vacay in Croatia. Maps Maponyane Our favourite hunk next door is in Japan taking in all the sites and experiencing the culture as well. One of the first few images he shared was of the bright lights of Shinjuku, Tokoyo. 2am in Tokyo: Shinjuku Lights #Shinjuku #Tokyo #Japan A post shared by Maps Maponyane (@mmaponyane) on Aug 13, 2017 at 10:09am PDT Thereafter, Maponyane shared images of himself visiting the Zen Buddhist temple of Kinkaku-ji. It is one of the most popular buildings in Japan, attracting a large number of visitors annually. It is designated as a National Special Historic Site and a National Special Landscape, and it is one of 17 locations making up the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto which are World Heritage Sites. 👓🏯 A post shared by Maps Maponyane (@mmaponyane) on Aug 16, 2017 at 12:28pm PDT While we wait with baited breath to see what these two get up to next, you can share your snaps with us on Instagram @IOL_Lifestyle.
