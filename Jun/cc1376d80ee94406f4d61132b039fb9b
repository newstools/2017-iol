Police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart, said that Bongile Klaas pleaded guilty to a charge of murder earlier this week and was sentenced in the Storms River Regional Court. During December 2015, Klaas had an argument with his son, 25-year-old Masixola Sofaya, and stabbed him multiple times in the back. The incident took place at their home in Coldstream in Storms River. Sofaya died at the scene. Humansdorp Cluster Commander, Brigadier John Lebok, commended the investigating team and said "the safety of our community is a top priority for SAPS and we will make every endeavour to ensure that offenders face the consequences of their actions."
