JOHANNESBURG – An unbeaten Rudi Second century led a commanding batting display by the Knights as they dominated the opening day of their Sunfoil Series clash against the Cape Cobras at the Recreation Ground in Oudtshoorn on Friday. Wicket-keeper Second made 119 (176 balls, 14x4) – his 17th career century – as the visitors marked their maiden appearance at the stadium by amassing 376/4. There were also three other half-centurions, while Werner Coetsee (44 not out) was closing in on a fourth after sharing an unbroken fifth-wicket stand of 88 that took the defending champions to stumps in complete control. The central franchise had won the toss and opted to bat at the start, with Keegan Petersen falling cheaply to franchise debutant Michael Cohen (2/87) for 14. But Grant Mokoena made 56 (80 balls, 6x4, 1x6) and shared in a second-wicket stand of 98 with captain Pite van Biljon (56 off 117 balls, 5x4). Second then added 153 for the fourth wicket with David Miller, who hit 67 (137 balls, 10x4), as the Knights made the Cobras toil. Cohen was the pick of the bowlers, while fellow franchise debutant Kyle Simmonds took 1/91. African News Agency (ANA)
