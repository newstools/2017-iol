Stephen Cook and David Miller shared a 138-run third-wicket partnership to help the South Africa A team to a solid 274/4 at stumps of Day One of the first four-day match in the two-match series at Tuks Oval in Pretoria on Saturday. Opening batsman, Cook top scored with an excellent 120 from 252 balls (eight fours), while Miller struck a 115-ball 78 including 10 boundaries after the hosts won the toss and elected to bat first on a wicket that was a challenge to both sides. The home side started out well with a 57-run opening stand between Cook and captain Aiden Markram (22), followed by another strong, 73-run partnership with Rudi Second (32) before the opener’s solidifying effort with Miller. India A’s Mohammed Siraj and Shahbaz Nadeem accounted for all of the wickets of the day, returning figures of 2/51 and 2/81 respectively. Khaya Zondo and Beuran Hendricks were not out on four and none respectively at the close of play. Day Two kicks off at 9.30am on Sunday. Cricket South Africa
