JOHANNESBURG - A new mobile app has launched to help you get the right nutrition called HAPI. It works by taking photos of your meals and a qualified nutritionist will tell you what you should or should not be eating. They will also be giving you advice on which exercise methods would work for you. When you start with HAPI, you'll get to interact with a coach who promises to follow your weight loss progress every step of the way. You visit the HAPI website and you can download the App via Google Play or on the Apple Store.   - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
