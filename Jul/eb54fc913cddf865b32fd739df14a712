Johannesburg - Former Gupta PR firm Bell Pottinger is set to face a disciplinary hearing over its involvement with Oakbay Capital and the Guptas, the DA confirmed on Tuesday. This follows a complaint by the party accusing the firm of sowing racial divisions through their work with the company and controversial family. The DA earlier confirmed it had laid a complaint with the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) over Bell Pottinger's violation of the association's Professional Charter and Code of Conduct. “PRCA agreed to the DA’s request for an investigation into Bell Pottinger after the Gupta emails revealed that the company launched a racially charged propaganda campaign for the benefit of their clients, the Guptas," the party said at the time. The party in a statement confirmed the PRCA is set to proceed with a disciplinary hearing against the PR firm and welcomed the decision. "Both the DA and Bell Pottinger are now required to submit summaries of our cases and copies of all documents, to be considered as evidence, within 10 working days. "Bell Pottinger designed and carried out a hateful and divisive propaganda campaign for the Guptas and the Zumas in our country, which is still dealing with a very painful past." The DA added that it looked forward to making representations at the hearing so it "can ensure Bell Pottinger is held accountable for their actions". The hearing will begin on August 18, 2017 in London. IOL
