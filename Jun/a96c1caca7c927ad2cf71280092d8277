Hastings, England - Europe's crazy golf
elite pitched their putters against a slew of obstacles at the
Crazy Golf World Championships at a seaside town on England's
south coast. Sixty-six crazy golfers took to the links at Hastings
Adventure Golf - dubbed the spiritual home of crazy golf by the
British Minigolf Association - to compete for the Â£1,000
(about R16 000) winner's purse. "It's very competitive", said former world champion Chris
Harding. "You can sort of tell; holes-in-one, there's a loud
roar from a lot of players, can put a lot of people off, but
you've got to put that to the back of your mind." Competitors had to contend with obstacles including a
six-foot lighthouse, a paddlewheel and a windmill as they
navigated the course. After a hard-fought battle, 23-year-old Olivia Prokopova
from the Czech Republic triumphed over her mostly male rivals
for the championship, completing the 18-hole course in 31
strokes. "It is incredible, it is a big tournament and a big win for
me", Prokopova said of her victory.
