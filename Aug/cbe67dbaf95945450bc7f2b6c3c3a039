London - The search is still on for a road-rage jogger who shoved a woman into the path of a London bus. The Metropolitan Police force said Saturday that a man arrested earlier this week has now been "eliminated from the investigation." The 41-year-old American investment banker was apprehended Thursday on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. His lawyers later released a statement saying he was not involved and could prove he was in the US at the time of the May 5 incident. The arrest came after police released surveillance camera footage of the incident, showing a jogger in shorts and T-shirt banging into a pedestrian, who tumbled in front of a double-decker bus. The bus stopped just before hitting the woman. Police say "inquiries continue" to identify the jogger. AP
