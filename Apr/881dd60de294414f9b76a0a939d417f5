If you spot a convoy of Toyota Land Cruisers with flags from African countries pass you on the highway, chances are you have seen the ‘4x4 explorers’. The group of 26 foreigners will spend two months touring Africa. Their journey started in Durban, South Africa on April 15.  Twenty five years ago Thomas Foo and his friends had a crazy idea to travel around the world using their Land Cruiser 4x4s. That idea turned into years of travel to some of the world’s most beautiful places and some great photographs for the memory books.  Foo has been so mesmerised by South Africa’s beauty that he has decided to make Durban a point of entry or departure on future trips.  The group shipped their 9 vehicles to Durban earlier this month. They spent a few days exploring Durban, including visiting the beachfront, Moses Mabhida Stadium, Hare Krishna Temple in Chatsworth and Victoria Street Market. Also part of their must see places in South Africa include Cape Town’s Garden Route, Kruger National Park and Stellenbosch. After completing their tours in South Africa, they will visit Namibia, Zambia, Tanzania and Botswana. Their trip will culminate on June 12 in Mombasa in Kenya.  “It has been our fifth time to South Africa and everytime we visit it surprises us more. We have people from Australia, Singapore, China and India on this trip, who have been bowled over by South Africa’s beauty and the warmth of its people. “We an outdoor group and want to focus on game drives, camping and the mountains during this trip. There is much to be seen in Africa and we hope to explore on our two month travels,” he said.  The group stayed at the Mandalay B&B in Durban North and headed to Sani Pass, west of KwaZulu-Natal earlier this week. Last year the group visited Kuala Lumpur, China and Mongolia before heading to London. clinton.moodley@inl.co.za
