Brentwood, Essex - For the past five years, Ford of Europe has entertained us each Christmas with a Snowkhana stop motion animation video featuring a miniature Ford Fiesta WRC car driven by Mental Block, and starring a host of familiar characters in hilarious situations. This Christmas, for the first time, Snowkarma: Naughty or Nice goes interactive, so you get to choose whether Mental Block and his Fiesta WRC take the naughty route or the nice route. Along the way, you may find yourself burning Christmas trees down (or not!), helping push Santa’s sleigh out of the snow or avoiding Brussels sprouts as you race through a kitchen. And when you get to the end you’ll find out whether you are on Santa’s naughty list, or not. It took film-maker Andy Mills a month to create the more than 25 scenes, including 12 different set builds and almost 3000 still images, that make up the alternative and hidden scenes in Snowkarma: Naughty or Nice - you’ll need more than one go to see all of them. Enjoy.   IOL Motoring
