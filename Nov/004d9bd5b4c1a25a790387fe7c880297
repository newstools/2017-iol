Johannesburg - The South African launch of the new Crossland X gives Opel two models in the fast-growing crossover B segment, with the Mokka X positioned towards the more sporty end of the spectrum and the Crossland X as a more family-orientated vehicle.
 
It’s available here in a range of four models, featuring a mix of two engines, manual or automatic transmissions and three trim grades - Opel is hoping there’s something for every young family. The engines are actually the same 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol, with and without turbo boost. The naturally-aspirated version (only in the base model) is quoted at 60kW and 118Nm, while the Turbo is good for 81kW and 205Nm; the standard transmission is a five-speed manual, while a six-speed auto is available in the top Cosmo variant. But even the base model comes with cruise control, hill hold, LED daytime running lights, automatic headlights and traffic sign recognition, as well as a 18cm touchscreen for telephony via Bluetooth and music playback through six speakers via AM/FM or DAB radio, USB, Bluetooth or Apple CarPlay. The Enjoy and Cosmo variants up the ante with rain-sensing wipers, front and rear parking sensors, front foglights and a 20cm touchscreen for the rear-view camera and infotainment functions with voice control, navigation and dual USB ports.
