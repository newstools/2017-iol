Parliament - Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane is busy with cabinet business and won't be able to be grilled by MPs on Wednesday over his relationship with the Gupta family. "The report from that office is that the minister is still tied up with issues of the cabinet but he's willing that as a committee we must liaise with him. At any time he is ready [to appear before MPs] in the event its not in conflict with his other engagements, so he will not be able to make it now," Sahlulele Luzipho, chairman of Parliament's portfolio committee on mineral resources said. Earlier in the morning, African National Congress (ANC) MPs resolved to call Zwane to appear before the committee on Wednesday. Parliament's House Chair, Cedric Frolick, directed the committee to conduct an inquiry into allegations in the media of Zwane's supposed corrupt relationship with the Guptas. Luzipho informed the committee when he inquired how the inquiry should be run, Frolick had suggested the minister be called to answer questions from MPs. Democratic Alliance MPs objected to the process saying it was akin to being "rammed through the committee without indicating what the process will be". A vote was called with the ANC MPs using their majority to resolve the minister be called on Wednesday. The ANC rejected the DA allegations, saying they were not protecting the minister and they wanted answers "now". The committee adjourned for ten minutes so one of the minister's advisers could call him. However, his schedule did not allow him to appear before the committee, MPs were informed. Allegations against Zwane include that he used the Gupta's private jet to fly from Switzerland to Dubai, that the family paid for his medical expenses, and that he was involved in money laundering and racketeering during his days as Free State Agriculture MEC African News Agency
