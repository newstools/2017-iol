As the days get longer and the sunshine’s brighter, you might be thinking about hosting a party and inviting all your friends and neighbours.  With so many complex flavours and extreme differences in beer, bready, caramel, hoppy, and citrusy flavours of beer, it pairs much better with food than some of the flavours you find in wine.  With beer, you taste robust flavours and most of us already know how to taste our food, it makes for a harmonious partnership of flavours.  The two keys to pairing beer with food are either accentuating a food flavour or balancing it. Keeping in mind that every taster has a unique palate doesn't hurt either. It's all about finding harmonies to complement each other and staying away from any overpowering flavours.  It can be difficult to find the perfect match, but perfection should not be the goal here, creativity and enabling others to open their minds by tantalising their taste buds is your benchmark. If you take that approach then your tasters will undoubtedly enjoy their experience and discover something new.
