The fourth stage of the Tour of Dubai was cancelled on Friday because of strong winds that posed a danger to the riders, organisers said. The 172km penultimate stage between Dubai and Hatta would have left riders exposed to extremely windy conditions. "Out of concern for the riders' security it was decided to cancel the fourth stage and hold the final stage (Saturday) as planned," organisers said. Germany's Marcel Kittel leads the overall standings going into the 124km final stage around Dubai on Saturday. The Astana team's Andrey Grivko was kicked off the Tour on Thursday for punching Kittel.
