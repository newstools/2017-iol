Rome - The fake ancient Roman centurions that routinely harass
tourists near the Colosseum and other landmarks of the Eternal City
have been banned once again, Rome city council said on Friday. Previous attempts to outlaw the practice were struck down on
technicalities by an administrative court. The centurions - who usually pose with plastic swords, helmets and
shields - were banned from practically all of the historic centre, a
statement said. Transgressors will be fined 400 euros (460 dollars), the council
warned. As well as being an eyesore, the centurions are routinely accused of
demanding extortionate amounts of money to pose for pictures and
reacting aggressively to insufficient tips. A couple of years ago, a
Romanian TV crew filmed them demanding 100 euros for a snap. dpa
