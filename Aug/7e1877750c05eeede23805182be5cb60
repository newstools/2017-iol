The device provides a form of transcranial direct current stimulation, which means a low voltage jolt of electricity is applied to specific parts of the brain. This aims to increase or decrease the brain cell activity in the region. The headset contains electrodes that sit over the frontal lobe of the brain, which is an area associated with depression. The idea is that people would use the device at home, but this would be co-ordinated with doctors. Trials are under way at hospitals in the US and South Korea. - Daily Mail
