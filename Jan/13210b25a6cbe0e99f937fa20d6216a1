Neighbours and a security officer nabbed the men as the mother-of-two ran from her car, screaming, after having been held up at gunpoint. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said she had been talking to a resident in ZK Matthews (Nicholson) Road when the two men approached her. She said her instincts immediately kicked in to get away. “He had the gun cocked at my stomach,” she recalled. “He didn’t even need to say anything. I knew what it was and thought of my children.” She said her immediate reaction was to throw her car keys and run but she was worried about the person who was standing with her. “So I went screaming down the road and kept looking back. I thought if they started the car they might chase after me,” she said. When they failed to start her car, they gave up and casually continued walking down the road. “They weren’t even running,” said the woman. Neighbours heard her screams and ran out of their homes in pursuit of the men. A security officer driving past noticed the commotion, screeched to halt, turned his car around and joined the residents around Binns and Edmonds roads in their chase. “The community was wonderful,” she said, also praising the security officer. Blue Security’s operations manager Brian Jackson said the officer called for back-up and immediately pursued the two suspects, whom he found, still running, at the corner of Deodar and Ormiston roads. “He cornered the men and prevented them from running any further before drawing his firearm and demanding that they lie face down on the ground. “A back-up officer arrived and assisted him with the arrests,” he said. “While they were on their way to the police station, a resident reported that a cocked 9mm firearm had been found near the perimeter fence on a property in Deodar Road near the scene of the arrest. “The firearm was recovered by the police,” he said.
