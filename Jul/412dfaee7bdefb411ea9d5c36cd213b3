Cape Town - The Economic Freedom Fighters have published the party's written submission to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete on why the opposition part believed the vote on the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma should take place via secret ballot. The firebrand opposition party, which is led by former ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema, posted their submission on Twitter. In June the ConCourt ruled that the decision for a secret ballot vote in a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma lay with National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng read out the judgment, saying Mbete was wrong when she claimed she did not have the powers to allow for a secret ballot vote.       He said the Constitutional Court did not have the power to order the speaker to make such a decision. Many political observers believe that a secret ballot could cause irrevocable damage to the ANC, as it would make it easier for MPs who are opposed to state capture and the scandal-ridden Zuma administration to vote with the opposition, in defiance of the ruling party's directive to toe the party line.Â
