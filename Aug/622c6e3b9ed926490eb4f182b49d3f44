Meghan Markle, 36,portrays Rachel Zane in the popular American drama series, and the star has admitted a lot of work goes into her appearance when she is shooting for the production, which sees her don a set of figure hugging underwear as well as an intense hair and make-up session. Speaking about her preparation ahead of being in front of the camera to the American publication The Star, the brunette beauty - who is currently dating Prince Harry - said: "People watch me as Rachel Zane on the show, who's so polished and so put together ... in real life that is not what it looks like. "But that includes Spanx and two hours of hair and make-up." But the American star has hinted she was surprised by her character's wardrobe, which she believes is unlike the dress sense any other paralegal would have. Speaking previously about her costume, she said: "People often say dress for the part that you want, not the part that you have, and I can't think of any paralegal that was dressing like Rachel did. "She was dressing for the role and the seriousness that she wanted people to treat her with." However, Meghan does believe Rachel's attire is "crisp" and contributes to making her character feel "confident". She added: "Rachel's quintessential power look is a crisp, white button-down with the collar a little popped, sleeves rolled up and a high-waisted pencil skirt. It's a look that makes her feel confident and come across like she really means business."
