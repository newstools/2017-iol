It has been on everyone’s lips this week. Social media was abuzz when The Train Suite Shiki-shima in Japan was launched.  Now people are hoping to get their hands on a ticket, but it would not be easy. Booking for the sought after train has been sold out since 2018.  Now with the demand so high for such a luxury train, one that showcases the country's scenic spots and culture, it's not hard to see why everyone booked from as early as last year. The train that sells for around $10,000 per person for its top of the range suite for a four-day trip from Tokyo to Hokkaido launched on Monday. The train departs from 13½ at Tokyo’s Ueno station—which was built exclusively for the train.  According to The Guardian, the  train journeys go towards rice fields, mountains, and seacoast, stopping to visit ancient shrines and temples, working farms and vineyards, and artisanal ateliers along the way.  That’s not all, the 17-suite Shiki-Shima makes one, two and three-night round trips through northeast Japan. The train has been dubbed as one of the best luxury trains there is. Designer Ken Kiyoyuki Okuyama gave the train a futuristic view and the food, prepared by Japan's first Michelin-starred chef, Katsuhiro Nakamura will reflect a specific region that the train passes.
