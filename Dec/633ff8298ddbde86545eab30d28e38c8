Cape Town - Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi says police and traffic officials will remain vigilant to curb carnage on the roads during the holiday season. Maswanganyi said on Wednesday that, while ensuring road safety was an all-year priority, it was inevitable that authorities would double their efforts during the holiday season, when national routes such as the N1, N2, N3 and N4 experienced an increase in the number of vehicles travelling to various destinations. "Our traffic law enforcement officers will continue to conduct more roadblocks throughout the country during this festive season and beyond," he said. "Of particular interest our law enforcement operations will target enforcement of legislation of wearing seat-belts, using cellphones while driving and unroadworthy vehicles, while they continue to clamp down on drunken driving, excessive speed and other moving violations." Officials have not yet released the death toll from road accidents during the Christmas holiday. African News Agency (ANA)
