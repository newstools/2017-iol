Budapest, Hungary - Kimi Raikkonen's British Grand Prix tyre problem was caused by external factors and not by structural weakness, according to Pirelli. Raikkonen and his Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel each suffered left front tyre problems in the closing laps at Silverstone two weeks ago, forcing both to pit. Pirelli has already said Vettel's issue was caused by a slow puncture. That problem dropped Ferrari's championship leader from third to seventh, slashing his advantage over Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton to a single point with half the season remaining, while Raikkonen ended up third. On Wednesday, ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, Pirelli said an analysis of Raikkonen's tyre had found specific damage "consistent with contact against an external body". It said no issues had emerged connected with the tyre itself.   Reuters  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
