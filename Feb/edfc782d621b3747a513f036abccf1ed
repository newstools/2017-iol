 Cape Town’s polo scene is the fastest growing in South Africa and as a result, Val de Vie Estate is adding two more fields to the estate’s offering. At the end of 2016 more than 500 chukkas were played at Val de Vie which is on par with polo clubs across the world. Cape Winelands estate living is in high demand with more and more consumers buying houses and relocating to estates in search of secure, luxury living. An expression of a luxury lifestyle for those who can afford it, polo events provide valuable networking opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs. Dubbed world-wide as the ‘king of sports’, polo is unique in terms of the platform it provides. Polo events attract a combination of upper middle class and high net worth (HNW) attendees and polo aficionados. The events are also extremely social and one does not need have a thorough understanding of the nuances of the sport to really enjoy the action and the event itself. With polo being a sport for the well-heeled, annual polo tournaments such as the Veuve Clicquot Masters Polo Cape Town is now one of city’s most anticipated events. It is a blend of luxury, fashion, polo, fine champagne with South Africa’s most elegant company present. The events economy is a big revenue and jobs driver, and a vital part of the Western Cape’s tourism industry. Events that take place specifically in areas such as Paarl/Franschhoek in particular bring much needed stimulus to the economy of these smaller towns. Cape Town's mayoral committee member for tourism, events and economic development, Garreth Bloor, said the biggest boon to the city's coffers, is high-profile sporting events, which attract a large number of domestic and international participants and media. Further multi-year agreements for more anchor events are in the process of being concluded and this will add a significant amount to the revenue generated annually. The Veuve Clicquot Master Polo will be taking place at the Val De Vie Estate on the 4th of March.
