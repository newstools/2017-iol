Cape Town - Launched alongside the RS5 this week, Audi has expanded its five-cylinder range with the release of the new TT RS and RS3 Sportback models. The latest version of Audiâ€™s 2.5-litre five-cylinder turbopetrol is a gem of an engine and it was introduced earlier this year with the RS3 sedan.
The latest TT RS is powered by the same engine, producing 294kW and 480Nm, and sending power to all four wheels through a seven-speed S Tronic transmission and quattro drivetrain. Being 70kg lighter than the RS3, the TT RS hits the 100 mark in just 3.7 seconds while top speed is governed to the same 250km/h (or optionally 280). For the first time in a series production Audi, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDS) are used in the rear lights as an option. These emit an especially homogenous and precise light, and they look visually impressive with their 3D design. The virtual cockpit with the 31cm screen in the instrument panel comes standard, as do RS sports seats in perforated nappa leather, MMI Navigation Plus, Comfort Key and Parking System Plus. The TT RS is priced at R963 000. Audi RS3 now available as a Sportback The latest Audi RS3 Sportback joins the sedan that was launched earlier this year. Selling for R30 000 less than the four-door, the Sportback is powered by the same 2.5-litre five-cylinder turbo engine with outputs of 294kW and 480Nm. According to Audi, the five-pot power plant whisks the RS3 Sportback to 100km/h in just 4.1 seconds and the governed 250km/h top speed can be increased to 280km/h on customer request. Like the sedan, the RS3 Sportback features a dual-clutch S tronic automatic gearbox with launch control, and front-biased quattro drive. Price: R895 500 Drive360
