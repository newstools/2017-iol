Cape Town - It has been four years since Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was established. The EFF celebrated their fourth anniversary on Wednesday in Durban and had a lot to say on various issues. "Dictators are people who change the constitution for their own personal gain. Our constitution doesn't even allow that," said EFF leader, Julius Malema. He also declared that he will never return to the "dead" African National Congress. "We are building our own ANC that will fight. That is the EFF." The party has also slammed rules by the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal that ban free political gatherings in campuses. "The university argued that this is due to the fact that they do not allow political rallies in their campuses. We condemn this as it is consistent with apartheid and fundamentally anti-intellectual," the political party said in a statement. It is a shame that UKZN, in an effort to suppress FeesMustFall Movement has elected to do backward and anti-intellectual a strategy. #UKZN — #EFFTurns4 (@EFFSouthAfrica) July 26, 2017 The party drew parallels between the university and intimidation under Apartheid law. When the students do so, the university surrounds them with men and women of guns; the form of intimidation we saw under apartheid. #UKZN — #EFFTurns4 (@EFFSouthAfrica) July 26, 2017 "Freedom of Assembly is a matter of our Bill of Rights without which we could never claim to have broken with an apartheid past."
