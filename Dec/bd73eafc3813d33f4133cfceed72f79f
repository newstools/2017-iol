Johannesburg - New ANC leader Cyril
Ramaphosa said on Tuesday the "Top Six" of South Africa's ruling
party comprised politicians from different sides of its
ideological divides and he expected the party to emerge from
this week's leadership conference stronger. Analysts have warned that the party's top decision-making
group could fail to agree on policy, with three politicians
apiece drawn from the Ramaphosa camp and that of his rival,
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. "The leadership that has been chosen is a unity leadership,"
Ramaphosa told reporters at the conference. "It's a leadership
that combines different views and approaches that were prevalent
in the conference prior to the election."Â  Read more #ANC54 stories here: #ANC54: Mabuza and Magashule 'used a women's campaign as a step ladder' Threats of #ANC54 collapse as Ramaphosa faction calls for recount  Reuters
