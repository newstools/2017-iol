It’s spring but with this cocktail Belvedere Vodka makes it feel like summer all year round. Real fruit delivers a bright and natural lemon and lime brightness to the vodka. The aromatic citrus notes take you elsewhere, where the climate is warm and invigorating. This spring time escape is the result of three separate macerations of citrus peels, Italian and Argentine lemons, and Mexican limes, with no artificial flavours or sugar added. Enjoy spring refreshment any month of the year.
