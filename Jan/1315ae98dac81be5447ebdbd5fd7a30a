Spokesperson Theo Layne said the City responded to a fire on the upper slopes of the mountain above Bezweni Lodge, Somerset West.

Layne appealed to the public to donate refreshments, both solids and liquids, to the Strand Fire Department, where the management team would ensure that they were distributed to the fire crews who are trying to control the intense fire. A Fire and Rescue Service logistics officer will ensure that the refreshments are distributed. He said the fire was spreading rapidly, to the extent that the firefighters continued working overnight on Tuesnesday, and would continue their work into Thursday.There is also a possibility that they will still be fighting the fire tomorrow. The firefighters are working tirelessly, he said.Meanwhile, City director for Safety and Security Richard Bosman said a fire in the Bo-Kaap area had been contained on Tuesday afternoon. Cape Times
