M-Net has been lining up a glamorous group of celebrity contestants for its new local series Dancing With the Stars SA (DWTS SA), including acting legend Frank Opperman, award-winning TV presenter Thembisa Mdoda, actress Juanita De Villiers, former Miss SA Liesl Laurie and South Africa’s proudest mom, Odessa Swarts.
This week the channel confirmed that actress Zola Nombona would also be waltzing her way on to the glitzy Dancing With the Stars stage next year. “I am very excited about being on DWTS SA. I’m also really nervous because this experience will be completely out of my comfort zone but I’m willing to take on the challenge. I’m excited to push myself and see how I can morph into a dancer. I have never been in any type of competition and being part of such a spectacular show is amazing. I have never been afforded such an opportunity before and I’m taking this one by the horns,” she said.   Ready to sizzle on the stage next year: it's @zolanombona!

I know I will have pains in places I have never imagined, but I’m ready for the challenge and will do my best at all times. I know that a competition like this needs mental tenacity. I plan to keep a positive attitude and mindset to keep motivated,” Nombona said. Nombona’s accolades include a Golden Horn award last year for best lead actress in the movie, Ingoma. The Eastern Cape-born actress is also known for her role as “Shado”, a streetwise teenager in the second season of South African TV drama series Intersexions in 2013. Dancing with the Stars SA, in which local celebrities will put their best foot forward with the help of professional Latin and ballroom dancers, starts on M-Net channel 101 on February 4.
