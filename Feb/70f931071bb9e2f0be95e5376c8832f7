Amor Vittone says Joost van der Westhuizen is now “flying with the angels without pain” following the death of the Springbok legend on Monday afternoon. Van der Westhuizen and Vittone were the South African version of the Beckhams when they got married in late 2002. The Springbok hero and the popstar singer were a perfect match, and they had two children – son Jordan and daughter Kylie, who are now 13 and 10 respectively. But the sex video scandal involving Van der Westhuizen in 2009 tainted things for the famous couple, and eventually led to the start of divorce proceedings. The former Bok captain, though, was diagnosed with a debilitating form of motor neuron disease (MND), called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and he was given around two to five years to live. Van der Westhuizen and Vittone decided to stop the divorce proceedings, but lived separately, with their children staying with their mother. The world renowned scrumhalf was eventually confined to a wheelchair, and succumbed to MND on Monday afternoon after being admitted to a Johannesburg hospital on Saturday. He was 45. Vittone took to Facebook on Monday to express her feelings following her estranged husband’s passing. “It is with a sore and heavy heart that we said goodbye to Joost an hour ago. We are surrounded by family and lots of love. “Joost, rest in peace and know that Jordan and Kylie will keep you close in their hearts. You are flying with the angels without pain. You were and are my first love. We love you! “Rest in peace with God and all the angels.” Van der Westhuizen was previously married to childhood sweetheart Marlene Terblanche, whom he divorced in 2001. He played in 89 Tests for the Boks and scored 38 tries, which was a South African record until it was surpassed by Bryan Habana in 2011.  ashfak.mohamed@inl.co.za  @ashfakmohamed Independent Media
