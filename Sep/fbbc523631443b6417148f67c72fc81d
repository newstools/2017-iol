There’s something about Maps Maponyane’s style that sets him apart from other South African male celebrities. His trip to New York is no different. As he razzled and dazzled his way along the streets of the Big Apple. Here are our favourite looks from his trip: Look 1: Maps is casual chic in this white and grey ensemble. I love his white and black palm tree shirt, paired well with a grey trouser. He completes the look with a black fedora and some shades. Look 2: Keeping his spring theme, Maps wears another floral shirt, but adds a bit of colour to his look. He was attending the Afropunk Fest at Commodore Barry Park. This urban park in the Fort Greene neighborhood of the New York City borough of Brooklyn is known for its music festivals. Look 3 Maps keeps it simple with a black shirt and hat. With the casual style of New York, Maps fits right in. He is on top of the Rockefeller Center, a large complex consisting of 19 high-rise commercial buildings covering 22 acres between 48th and 51st Streets in New York City. Look 4 What’s a visit to New York without a trip to SOHO. Here Maps meets the legendary Jon Stewart. His look is more laid back and casual. He is wearing a beige casual shorts with a white t-shirt. He pairs it with his specs. SOHO  is a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, which is known for its galleries and boutique shops.
