London - Prince Philip, the 96-year-old
husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, has been admitted to
hospital with an infection and will miss the formal opening of
parliament but he remains in "good spirits", a spokesman for
Buckingham Palace said. Philip, who is also known as the Duke of Edinburgh and has
sometimes drawn attention with headline-grabbing gaffes, has
been by the queen's side throughout her 65 years on the throne
and she has described him as "my strength and stay". "The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to King Edward VII
Hospital in London last night, as a precautionary measure, for
treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing
condition," a spokesman for the Palace said. "Prince Philip is in good spirits and is disappointed to be
missing the State Opening of Parliament and Royal Ascot," the
spokesman said. Prince Charles, the queen's son, will accompany her to the
opening of parliament. Philip in May said he would retire later this year from
active public life. Reuters
