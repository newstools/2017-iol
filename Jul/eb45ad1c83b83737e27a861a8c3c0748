Blac Chyna and Tyga have a good relationship at the moment. The 29-year-old model and reality TV star recently secured a restraining order against her former fiancÃ© Rob Kardashian, after he shared naked pictures of her online, but Chyna says she and her other famous ex Tyga have put their differences behind them. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, the star - who has daughter Dream, eight months with Rob and four-year-old King Cairo with Tyga - said: "I'm doing good. I'm just feeling blessed right now."

But Tyga admitted Rob was "blind" with love and didn't want to listen to the advice. He said: "I told him what he was going to deal with. I told him I was with her for three or four years, this is what you're going to deal with. She's just got a different mentality. She really is a good person at heart but she's been through a lot in her life and she didn't have people to help guide her. "I just knew a n***a like [Kardashian] ain't going to be able to handle someone like her. He's coming from a whole different world, he don't know how she move and think. But when you're in love and don't care what nobody else thinks... love blinds you."
