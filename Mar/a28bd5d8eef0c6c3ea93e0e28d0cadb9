Bologna, Italy - This just has to be the most exciting duty assignment for any Italian cop: driving one of the Bologna Highway Patrol’s two Lamborghini Huracan high-speed response vehicles. The Sant’Agata supercar maker has handed over a second Polizia-specification Huracan to the Highway Patrol to be used in emergency situations such as medical response and organ transport. Beautifully finished in distinctive Italian police blue with white lettering, the new 442kW, 5.2-litre V10 all-wheel drive supercopcar has narrow green, white and red Tricolore stripes down the waistline and special blue-tinted sidewalls on its Pirelli P Zero tyres. Special equipment includes a streamlined light bar on the roof, a tablet linked to the law-enforcement network, a police-issue dashcam with recording equipment, and emergency medical kit - including an on-board defibrillator, just in case the sight of a police vehicle coming up from behind at 320km/h gives some Italian motorist a heart attack. On a more serious note, the storage compartment in front has a refrigerated section for transport organs for transplant. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
