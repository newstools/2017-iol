A rampant Harry Kane netted four goals and Son Heung-min scored twice as Tottenham Hotspur thrashed Leicester City 6-1 in an entertaining Premier League clash at the King Power Stadium on Thursday night. Already certain of finishing second behind champions Chelsea, Spurs played as if the title race depended on the outcome of their visit to Leicester, who suffered a first home defeat after five straight wins. The lively Son set up Kane for a 25th-minute opener and made it 2-0 with a first-time shot on the turn in the 36th minute as the visitors dominated the opening half with some crisp passing. Ben Chilwell pulled one back for Leicester after the break, but that hardly made a dent against Mauricio Pochettino’s team. England international forward Kane struck three times to go top of the Premier League’s scoring chart with 26 goals, with Son scoring his second after some dazzling footwork created space for a neat low shot from 25 metres.
