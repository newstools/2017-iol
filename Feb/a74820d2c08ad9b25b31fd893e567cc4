Zach Galifianakis has joked that his kids' names are Pink Berry and Jared Leno. The 'Lego Batman Movie' star and his wife Quinn Lundberg become parents again to a little boy last November, whose name is reportedly Emmanuel Lundberg, and they also have a three-year-old son, whose name is unknown. While appearing on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' he revealed their joke names, with the younger one being called Jared Leno; a combination of 'Suicide Squad' star Jared Leto and US talk show host Jay Leno. Explaining the moniker Jared Leno, he quipped: "Being in LA, I didn't want to give them LA names. One of them is called Pink Berry. Pink Berry is the older one. And the other one is named Jared Leno. It's a cross between Jared Leto and Jay Leno." The 47-year-old star keep his work and private life separate and hasn't told his children what he does for a living, which is why his eldest was shocked to see his dad's face on a billboard. He told host Jimmy: "My kids don't know anything. We don't talk about what I do for a living, nor do my wife and I. When you are lucky enough to have a show in this town, there's billboards. I was driving with my son, and there's a bus that pulls up, and it had my picture on it. So I'm looking in my rear view mirror to see how my three-year-old son is reacting to it, and he looks over, and he sighs. As if to say, 'How long is this phase gonna last?' " Zach and his wife – who got married at the UBC Farm in Vancouver, British Columbia, in August 2012 – are planning to have more children in the future. Asked how many kids he'd like to have, Zach previously quipped: "I'd like to have 10 kids." Bang Showbiz
