 The International Wine Challenge (IWC) has announced that the Boschendal’s Appellation Series – Elgin 2015 Chardonnay has been awarded the Best Elgin Chardonnay Trophy. It’s also scooped the Best Chardonnay Trophy and ultimately the Best White Wine of South Africa Trophy at the 2017 IWC. The IWC is seen as one of the world’s finest judged wine competitions. Each medal-winning wine is tasted on three separate occasions by at least 10 different judges deeming the Elgin Chardonnay the best white wine in the country. Boschendal was one of the first chardonnay producers in South Africa, and has been making its Appellation Elgin range since 2012 – sourcing grapes from the 40-hectare Highfield Farms for over ten years. Having won multiple international awards for her Chardonnay, Boschendal winemaker and Chardonnay expert Lizelle Gerber says: “It’s a tremendous honour for our Chardonnay to be named the best white wine in South Africa this year. There are just so many fantastic Chardonnay’s now coming out of SA, particularly out of the 2015 vintage and to be judged “the best” by this acclaimed International panel is great praise indeed.” The Appellation Elgin 2015 Chardonnay Tasting Notes:  The Appellation Elgin 2015 Chardonnay undergoes an 11 month maturation process resulting in a crisp, lively flavour of dancing grapefruit and Golden delicious apple notes on the nose, and sweet citrus and oak accents, with a pleasing minerality on the palate.
