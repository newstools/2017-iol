CAPE TOWN – Western Province coach John Dobson has included Damian Willemse and Sikhumbuzo Notshe in his starting line-up to face the Sharks in the Currie Cup final at Kings Park on Saturday (4pm kickoff, SS1). Dobson has made a couple of positional switches to the backline. In one of those, Dillyn Leyds moves to the left wing to accommodate Willemse at fullback, while the other sees Ruhan Nel moving to outside centre to partner up with No 12 Huw Jones in place of the injured EW Viljoen. There are two changes upfront, with Notshe coming in at No 6 for Jaco Coetzee, who’s ruled out with concussion, and Cobus Wiese starting at No 7 in place of Kobus van Dyk, who drops to the bench. At the team announcement, Dobson made it clear that they aren’t just going to Durban to partake in what should be a thrilling final – they want to win the title while they’re at it. “It is a privilege for us to be involved in a Currie Cup final, and the players are determined to do our union and our faithful supporters proud on Saturday,” Dobson said. “We have grown so much as a team this season, and we have a chance to end it by lifting the Currie Cup trophy, so we want to make the most of every minute at Kings Park.” Teams For Currie Cup Final Sharks: 15 Garth April, 14 Kobus van Wyk, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Marius Louw, 11 Odwa Ndungane, 10 Curwin Bosch, 9 Louis Schreuder, 8 Daniel du Preez, 7 Jean-Luc du Preez, 6 Keegan Daniel, 5 Ruan Botha (captain), 4 Tyler Paul, 3 Ross Geldenhuys, 2 Franco Marais, 1 Thomas du Toit.
