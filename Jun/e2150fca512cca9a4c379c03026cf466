There is a new route Durban travellers can look forward to visiting. Sodurba, consisting of three different routes in areas like the Bluff, Yellowwood Park, Clairwood and Wilson Wharf areas, showcases the south of Durban perfectly.  The first route explores the KZN Whale Coast. The route starts at The Whale History Museum at the Maritime Museum. Visitors can take a scroll through the museum to explore the boats and the history of the whales. That is followed by a boat cruise at Wilson's Wharf, to WESSA Treasure Beach  and Brighton Beach. The next one is the Conservation Legacy Route that also goes to Wessa Treasure Beach, Bluff Nature Reserve, Bluff Eco Park, Wilderness Leadership School  and Stainbank Nature Reserve Castle and Art Gallery. The last route is multicultural. It explores the different cultural institutions in these areas, including Clairwood Shree Siva Soobramoniar Temple, Isipingo Gowshala and Mandir Temple, Isipingo Shree Siva Soobramoniar Temple and the Shri Sivan Soobramoniar Alayam.  Sodurba is a refreshing new tourist route away from the usual tourist spots in Durban like Moses Mabhida Stadium and the Durban beachfront. The educational element is also important. Tourists are educated on numerous aspects of Durban life, it's people and their culture. We got treated to a mix of the activities on the route.  There are plans to launch more activities and routes as time progresses. Chairman of South Durban Tourism, Helga Du Preez, said additional tourist routes is perfect to boost tourism, create jobs and in turn have a positive economic growth in our city.  During the tour, environmental educator Andre Steenkamp boasted about the accessible accommodation offered in the Durban South area. This was especially so for Marine Drive on the Bluff that is home to many b&bs and guest houses. For further information, contact Sodurba Tourism on 031 467 0404.
