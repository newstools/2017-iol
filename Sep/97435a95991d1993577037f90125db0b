Sam Smith felt "physically sick" ahead of the release of his comeback single 'Too Good at Goodbyes' on Friday, although he is "so excited" to be returning to the music business. The 25-year-old singer's new song is his first new song since his 2015 Oscar-winning James Bond theme,'Writing's On the Wall'. In an interview with Apple Music, Sam said the new track is about him and a relationship he is was in. Sam sings: "But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry/And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry, "And every time you walk out, the less I love you/Baby we don't stand a chance/It's sad, but it's true, "I'm way too good at goodbyes." However, the British singer insists that his upcoming album is not a personal LP, as it only contains four songs about him. This album actually is not all about me. There's about four songs that are about me, and the rest are about different things and different people in my life and what they've gone through," he said.
