However, some of the price pressure has been alleviated by the significant moderation in inflationary pressures earlier in the supply chain. Specifically, producer prices at the agriculture level eased to 5.5 percent year-on-year in December from growth rates above 20 percent in the first quarter of last year, Investec says. In particular, grain price inflation dropped to 0.4 percent year-on-year in December from 79.2 percent year-on-year in January. A moderation in food price growth at the manufactured level would bode well for retail prices at the consumer level. However, in its January Monetary Policy Committee statement, the South African Reserve Bank noted that the expected food price disinflation may be attenuated by higher fuel prices and a rising trend in global food prices . Overall, the SARB still considers the risks to the inflation outlook to be moderately on the upside . BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE &nbsp;
