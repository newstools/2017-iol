TIME: 1hr 30mins + resting Prep: 15 mins
Cooks: 1hr 15 mins
Serves: 4 1.5-1.8kg spatchcock chicken
1 tbsp Jamaican jerk seasoning
2 spring onions
1 chilli
2 tbsp tamari
1 tbsp Demerara sugar
1 lime Make the jerk marinade. Trim the spring onions, and separate the white and the green ends. Finely chop the white ends and slide into a bowl. Save the green ends until later. Halve the chilli, flicking out the seeds and membrane for less heat, and finely chop. Finely grate the lime zest. Slide both into the bowl and stir in half of the lime juice, the jerk seasoning, demerara sugar, tamari, 1 tbsp oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Remove the packaging from the chicken and pop on to a roasting tin. Pour over the marinade and rub all over. Set aside for 30 mins to come to room temperature. Light your bbq and bring the coals to a medium temperature. Place the chicken skin side down over a hot part of the bbq and cook for 4-5 mins, or till well coloured. Flip over and cook for a further 4-5 mins. Transfer the chicken to a cooler part of the bbq and cook with the lid on for 1 hr-1hr 15 mins. To check if itâ€™s cooked through, insert a skewer into the thickest part of the thigh. The juices should run clear. If it needs a little longer, return the chicken to the grill for a further 5-10 mins before checking again. Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate and allow to rest for 20 mins before carving. Finely slice the green spring onion tops and scatter over. Serve on a platter with wedges of the remaining lime. Exclusive recipe by Sam Richards for Able & Cole. Independent
