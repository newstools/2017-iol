CAPE TOWN - The deadline agreement for the South African Post Office (SAPO) to assist in the distribution of social grants had not been met by November 17. This follows an announcement more than a month ago by Treasury that the South African Post Office (Sapo) will take over grant payments effective November 10. This agreement follows an arduous call for the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to find an alternate payments provider, following the expiry of their previous contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS). The failure to source an alternate payments provider has mounted great tumult on Social Development Minister, Bathabile Dlamini. Finally, following the agreement reached by the joint committee, the loose ends just had to be tied together. This was due to take place on November 17, with Sassa signing the agreement with Sapo.
