Brussels, Belgium - Volkswagen’s new Arteon fastback, due for South African release in the second half of 2018, has been awarded five stars in Euro NCAP testing. That rating recognises not only the new upmarket sedan’s level of protection for both adult and child occupants, but also its standard-fit driver aids and its score for pedestrian protection (the highest in its class to date), largely due to its emergency braking function. The five-star safety rating is a combination of the Arteon’s scores in four sub-sections: it scored 96 percent for adult occupant protection, 85 percent for child occupant protection, 85 percent for pedestrian protection, and 82 percent for safety assistance, thanks to the standard fitment of seatbelt reminders for for all seats, cruise control, front collision assist with emergency braking, and lane-keeping assistance. More safety features such as whiplash reducing head restraint and a proactive protection system that recognises critical situations, tightens seatbelts, and closes windows and the sliding roof but for a small gap, will be standard in some markets - but that doesn’t count for Euro NCAP assessment.
