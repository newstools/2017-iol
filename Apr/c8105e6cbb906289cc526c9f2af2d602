 LONDON - Alexis Sanchez is keen to be reunited with his former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola at Manchester City this summer. Sportsmail understands that Guardiola identified the Arsenal striker as a target months ago as City try to take advantage of his contract dispute at Arsenal. Sanchez has just one season left on his deal, with a new contract offered by the club so far unsigned. Sources close to the 28-year-old say he would welcome a reunion with Guardiola, and City are growing confident of landing Sanchez given that Arsenal’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League hang by a thread. Arsenal do not want to allow their talisman to leave in the summer, but might have to for fear of him departing for nothing in 2018. Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Patrick Kluivert is also keen on the Chilean, but fears that City, Manchester United and Chelsea may beat them to his signing. PSG manager Unai Emery does not share quite the same enthusiasm as Kluivert, and City’s Sergio Aguero has been discussed as an alternative in the French capital. Sanchez was fiercely booed by Arsenal supporters as their side lost 3-0 at Crystal Palace on Monday. Despite a backdrop of infighting and questions over Arsene Wenger’s future, the forward has 22 goals this season. It is no secret that Guardiola is looking to strengthen in attacking areas after seeing his side struggle to kill off teams. The City boss has consistently shifted blame from his porous defence, insisting the team do not score enough goals. Guardiola was seen embracing Sanchez after the 2-2 draw at the Emirates 10 days ago and before then had been forced to deny he had phoned the player about the prospect of a switch. Daily Mail
