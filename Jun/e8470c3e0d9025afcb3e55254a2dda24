Legacy Hotels & Resorts is going the extra mile to ensure that guests remain fully and thoroughly connected while staying at its hotels. The group today announced that, effective immediately, it has increased its bandwidth to allow its guests at select properties to enjoy unlimited Wi-Fi.  “Ours is the digital era. It’s not just a fact of life, but also a matter of great importance that we are digitally connected, at all times. So we reviewed our properties where Wi-Fi demand was highest and determined that it would better serve our guests to have broadband, unlimited Wi-Fi at these sites,” said Paddy Brearley, MD of Legacy Hotels & Resorts.  The properties affected by this development include: The Michelangelo Hotel; Michelangelo Towers; Raphael Penthouse Suites; DaVinci Hotel & Suites; Centurion Lake Hotel; The Commodore Hotel; PortsWood Hotel; and the Swakopmund Hotel & Entertainment Centre. At all other resorts and lodges, the managed Wi-Fi connectivity remains unchanged.  “We strive at all times to be gracious hosts to our very welcome guests, and I believe that increasing and uncapping the Wi-Fi bandwidth will demonstrate convincingly just how committed we are to that goal,” Brearley said. “The improved connection will moreover help our business guests to conduct their business more effectively, and our leisure guests to stay connected to their lives back-home and to share their holiday experiences with their social media followers.” Brearley added.
