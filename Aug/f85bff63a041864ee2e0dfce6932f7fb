London - Big brothers and sisters are worse drivers than their younger siblings, a UK report claims. A study found that older offspring are more likely to speed, get fines for motoring offences and have accidents. Researchers say that sibling rivalry is a longstanding family issue, in particular when arguing over who is the better driver. The report into the driving habits of 1395 motorists by Privilege Car Insurance reveals that 89 percent of eldest children speed, 35 percent have been fined, and 47 percent annoy other motorists by cutting them up. Some 46 percent admitted to hogging the middle of the road. Not only that, but 17 percent of first-born children said they applied make-up and 30 percent used their mobile phone while driving, all at a higher rate than their siblings. Eldest children had been involved in more minor and major accidents (20 percent and 11 percent) than middle (15 percent and 7 percent) and youngest children (13 percent and 4 percent). The research also suggests that big brothers are most likely to have an accident, with 22 percent having a minor incident and 15 percent having a serious incident in the past five years. At the other end of the scale, the best all-round drivers on our roads are the youngest children, as just 42 percent cut up other drivers and 36 percent hog lanes on the motorway. What about only children? The biggest surprise though came from only children. Often known for their general selfishness, they were found to be the least likely to hog the middle or outside lane (31 percent), or cut someone up (36 percent). Privilege offers a policy called DriveXpert, which involves a black box being inserted into the car which monitors how safely it is being driven.Â Sensible motorists are then rewarded with lower insurance premiums.
