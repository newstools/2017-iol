If Easter eggs were goals, Maritzburg United hunted them down easily in a 3-1 Absa Premiership win over Baroka FC at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg on Friday. Two first-half goals in rainy conditions set the home side comfortably towards a seventh league triumph of the season, and a consolidation of their top eight place. The points lifted them one place up the standings, above Polokwane City, to seventh. Defender Kwanda Mngonyama grabbed his first of the campaign with a first-time strike as the ball fell from a defensive clearance off a corner kick in the 11th minute. By the 25th minute, Maritzburg had doubled their lead, again from a set-piece move that exposed goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke. Playmaker Kurt Lentjiesâ€™ free kick was half-cleared, and defender Bevan Fransman whipped the ball back in to the far post where striker Mohau Mokate headed in for his fourth goal of the season. Early after the break, the visitors were rewarded with a penalty claim against Mngonyama in the 60th minute. Substitute midfielder Jose Garcia converted the chance to make for a tense finish to the game. Play swung from end to end, and the home team made the most of a free kick to regain their two-goal advantage and seal the victory. Fransman blasted the ball in from the edge of the box after Lentjies was tripped in the 87th minute.
