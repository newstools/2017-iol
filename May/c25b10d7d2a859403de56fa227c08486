Nu Metro will host its second Guys’ Night in the Xtreme cinemas at Nu Metro The Glen (Jhb), Menlyn Park (Pta), Canal Walk (CT) and Ballito Junction (KZN) on Thursday, 18 May.  This special nationwide pre-release screening event will showcase director Ridley Scott’s highly anticipated new horror thriller Alien: Covenant – the latest instalment in the iconic Aliens series of movies. Nu Metro’s Guys’ Night will premiere Alien: Covenant on some of the biggest cinema screens in South Africa, with crystal-clear RealD digital projection and powerful 360-degree Barco Auro and Dolby Atmos sound. One of the original film’s taglines was “in space no one can hear you scream” – and this exclusive Guys’ Night screening promises to make even the toughest guys scream loudly. It is a fast-paced, action-packed spectacle – filled with scenes of pure horror, as the Xenomorph-monster starts chasing her victims. Guys’ Night is exclusively for men to see what all the talk is about before the movie releases at cinemas nationally the next day.  The story in Alien: Covenant begins with crew members (Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup) of the colony ship Covenant discovering what they think is an uncharted paradise, as part of their mission towards a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy. While there, they meet David (Michael Fassbender), the synthetic survivor of the doomed Prometheus expedition. The mysterious world soon turns dark and dangerous when a hostile alien life-form forces the crew into a deadly fight for survival. Their discovery of a threat beyond their imagination forces them to attempt a harrowing escape like no other. l Alien: Covenant carries a 16 age restriction, for intense violence and bad language. Nu Metro Guys’ Night is presented in partnership with SABC 3’s Expresso breakfast show. Strictly no girls allowed. Enter the competition below:
