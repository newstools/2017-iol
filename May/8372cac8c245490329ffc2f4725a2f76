My Children My Africa, by renowned playwright, novelist and director, Athol Fugard, will be staged on Monday, the 8th of May at the Halala Community Hall in Soshanguve. The play is currently a setwork in the government syllabus, making the play a valuable complement to the learning schedule of students. Fugard, whose novel Tsotsi was famously adapted into the 2005 Academy Award-winning film, is best known for his political plays that opposed the apartheid system. Directed by acclaimed actor and director Letlhogonolo Ngobeni, My Children My Africa looks at apartheid South Africa through the drama set at Zolile High school. Here, an inter-school debate takes place starring Thami, a teenage boy from a poor township school and Isabel, a teenage girl from the town's middle-class white school. Inspired by the success of the occasion, Mr. M, the head teacher of the township school, persuades the young pair to join together as a team, and coaches them in preparation for a national school English literature quiz.

Thami is sucked into the politics of violence and Mr. M is murdered by a lynch mob who believes he is a police collaborator. Thami escapes from South Africa to join the rebels in the North and Isabel is left alone to pay her respects to the memory of Mr. M.
