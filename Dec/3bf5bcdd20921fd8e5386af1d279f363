Riaad Moosa tries to work this out with his hilarious one-man show, Life Begins - a snapshot into his life as a 40-year-old, a father of three children, husband, comedian, actor and with all the current cultural and political issues thrown in. Following sold-out shows across the country, Moosa returns by popular demand for the last Cape Town performance of Life Begins at the Cape Town International Convention Centre, on  December 16. “Even though I am now 40, in many ways, I feel like I’m still crawling and I’m looking back at my journey from being an aspirational doctor, coming from a relatively conservative Muslim background, where both my parents were doctors, and how I actually journeyed to becoming a stand-up comedian,” says Moosa As an award-winning comedian, actor, writer and presenter Moosa is one of South Africa’s most popular and acclaimed funny men, and he happens to be a qualified medical doctor too. The Life Begins tour will also see Moosa performing in Newcastle, Durban and Empangeni. *  The show is rated PG for language and takes place at Auditorium 1 at the Cape Town ICC. Doors open at 7.30pm and the show starts at 8.30pm. Ticket are priced from R150 and are available at Computicket.
