Cape Town – The owner of a BMW was killed by hijackers who apparently thought he was driving a new car. The 39-year-old cash-in-transit security guard was shot dead in what is suspected to have been a botched hijacking in Delft on Friday night. Andile Mabophe, 39, from Leiden, had stopped outside a friend’s home in N2 Gateway just after 7pm when he was ambushed by gunmen. It is believed Andile had been coming from his girlfriend’s home and was sitting in his BMW convertible when two armed men fired shots at him. Andile tried to run away, but was hit by bullets and died instantly. Witnesses told the Weekend Argus: “We think they were after his car which looked brand new. The men walked across the road and suddenly we heard gunshots.” Police say his stolen BMW had been recovered in the Delft area shortly after the incident. Police have yet to reveal how and where the vehicle had been found. At the scene, Andile was lying on the pavement amid shattered glass from his car’s window. Police spokesperson, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana, says cops have not made arrests yet. “Police found a 39-year-old man with gunshot wounds to his body. The victim died due to his injuries," she says. A case of murder has been opened for investigation. “Circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation. No one has been arrested at this stage.” Daily Voice
