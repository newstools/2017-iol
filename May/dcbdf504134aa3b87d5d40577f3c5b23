This is in the event the Constitutional Court rules in favour of a secret ballot. The ANCYL in eThekwini region has identified Makhosi Khoza, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and former finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, as possible “collaborators” with opposition parties. The Constitutional Court this week reserved judgment in the UDM’s application to clarify whether parliamentary Speaker Baleka Mbete had powers to call for a secret ballot in deciding Zuma’s fate. ANCYL eThekwini regional secretary Thinta Cibane said Khoza had made it clear how she would vote. “There are others we don’t trust. We don’t trust Pravin Gordhan and Jackson Mthembu any more. The ANC should remove people like them from Parliament with immediate effect,” said Cibane. He said although there were other untrustworthy party MPs, he did not believe they were enough to help the opposition to impeach Zuma. The ANCYL in eThekwini region said it would protest against Khoza at a book launch organised by Durban political think tank, Xubera Institute for Research and Development, in the city tomorrow. Khoza, who yesterday said she would vote to save the ANC rather than vote for an “amoral leader”, would be among guest speakers at the launch of a book, Making Africa Work. Other speakers include the book’s co-author, former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, and former Zimbabwean industry and international trade minister Nkosana Moyo. Cibane said another protest was planned at Khoza’s home in Hillcrest tomorrow to force her to resign from Parliament. Khoza said the planned protest was a threat to her safety. She called on the league to respect her views because she respected theirs. “They must not disrupt me, they must not intimidate me because I don’t intimidate them,” she said. ANC spokesperson in KwaZulu-Natal Mdumiseni Ntuli said it was unnecessary to protest against Khoza “even though she behaves strangely”. The Mercury
