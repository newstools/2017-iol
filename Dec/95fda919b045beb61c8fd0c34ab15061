CAPE TOWN - Travellers had shown a positive impulse to the Siemens AirDrop Initiative as all vouchers (1000) were redeemed in four hours, Siemens said. In an endavour to raise awareness on the Western Cape's drought crisis, Siemens had a one-day activation - the Siemens AirDrop Initiative - which saw voluntary passengers with enough unused (5kg or more) luggage receiving vouchers at the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, and on arrival at the Cape Town International Airport they had to collect their 5 litre bottles of water. The company said uncollected water would be donated to the Gift of the Givers. The head of the corporate communications at Siemens, Keshin Govender said, "The response from passengers was amazing, as the travellers understood the purpose of the initiative".

"Only through ingenuity can we overcome the constraints of outdated and wasteful methods. AirDrop is an example of what can be accomplished if we apply this type of thinking to all industries across the country," said Govender.
