DURBAN - Looking to strengthen distance running in the country, a Durban race has been included in the Run Your City series. The FNB Durban 10K CITYSURFRUN was launched on Tuesday and will form part of a series that includes the successful Cape Town 12 ONERUN and the Joburg 10K CITYRUN. “Following the blueprint of its sister-events, the FNB Durban 10K CITYSURFRUN will hero KwaZulu-Natal’s largest city,” said race organiser Michael Meyer of Stillwater Sports. “Rubbing shoulders with some of the world’s best middle distance runners, entrants will experience a 10km journey through the city, past a number of Durban’s iconic landmarks. Meyer said the route would be fast and flat which he hoped would make it one of the fastest 10km races in the world. “Add to the mix near perfect weather conditions, our goal of making this the fastest 10km in the world becomes even more achievable,” he said. “We will be targeting some big name athletes to race through the streets of Durban in October. “South Africa’s best athletes will have another opportunity to race against the world’s best ultimately uplifting the standard of South Africa’s distance running.” South African 5000m record-holder Elroy Gelant, who finished second at this year’s One Run said the introduction of these road races would benefit South African athletics. “This is exactly what we need to boost the distance running in South Africa, opportunities that reward our efforts in terms of prize money and opportunities to compete against the best in the world at home,” Gelant said. “Racing these top guys at home makes us even hungrier. I am really looking forward to racing in Durban on 8 October.” The Cape Town 12 has attracted some top distance athletes including inaugural winners four-time world champion Vivian Cheruiyot and Emmanuel Bett of Kenya. The Durban race is expected to attract an equally strong field when on October 8. The Mercury   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
