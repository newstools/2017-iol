Western Province Rugby have warned rugby fans in Cape Town that tickets for the Springbok Test against the All Blacks at Newlands cannot be sold for more than the face value of a particular ticket. This comes after a Gumtree post – which has seemingly been removed since – was circulated on social media on Tuesday, stating that the seller in Milnerton has 10 tickets for the October 7 Rugby Championship clash for sale for a whopping R25 000! The collective total at face value is R5 900 – four Jan Pickard Stand seating tickets (R850 each), one Grandstand seating ticket (R950), one Danie Craven Stand ticket (R950) and four standing-room tickets (R150 each). All available public tickets, which were fewer than 22 000 in the 48 000-capacity Newlands, were sold in less than an hour on Monday. “While public tickets that went on sale on September 11 are currently sold out, the public are advised to be cognisant of the fact that only tickets bought from wprugby.computicket.com, Computicket outlets or the stadium box office are guaranteed valid for the Rugby Championship Test match between the Springboks and the All Blacks at Newlands on October 7,” WP Rugby said in a statement on Tuesday. “These are the only outlets which are licenced to sell tickets to Newlands. Tickets obtained from any other source cannot be guaranteed valid. Newlands 2017 season tickets are valid for the Test, with no further action required. “Please also be aware that the terms of sale prohibit the on-sale of tickets for a price greater than the face value of the ticket.” The Springboks are in New Zealand this week and will face the All Blacks in Albany on Saturday, after a 23-23 draw against the Wallabies in Perth last weekend.
