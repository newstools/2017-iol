Oslo, Norway â€“ BMW's next-generation M5 has been filmed revving its V8 engine on the streets of Oslo ahead of its planned debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September this year. The Video, filmed by Daniel Moen Hansen and posted on YouTube by BilNorge.no, shows three disguised next-gen M5 prototypes, but it's the third car (from 0:35s) that you have to listen up for as the driver gives it a good rev for the camera. So what do we know about BMW's next super-saloon? All the juicy details are still officially under wraps, but word on the street is that it will be powered by an uprated version of the current car's 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8, likely producing in the region of 440kW. Its biggest rival, the Mercedes-AMG E63 produces 420kW in standard form and 450kW in 'S' guise. The biggest departure from M5 tradition is that the super saloon will reportedly ditch its rear-wheel-drive format for a version of BMW's xDrive all-wheel-drive system, although it will be programmed to send all the engine's urge to the back wheels when the driver selects M Dynamic mode.
