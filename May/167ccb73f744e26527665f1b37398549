“We believe that the Eskom board was irrational and has been taking irresponsible decisions, and thus we call for the dissolution of the board of Eskom with immediate effect,” Sanco general secretary Skhumbuzo Mpanza said. He appealed to the African National Congress to reject Molefe's resignation from Parliament – where Molefe has been an ANC MP for about three months. Molefe was a "conflicted individual" whose return may compromise the organisation and bring about disillusionment among staff members who had been serving the country with diligence. “Parliament is a serious place for national discourse and it must not be used as a playing ground for people who are not serious about matters of the peoples of South Africa,” Mpanza said.
