Johannebsurg - Adventurous South African traveller Andrew Russel will attempt to traverse the African continent, from Cairo to Cape Town, travelling by motorbike across eight countries in nine days in a bid to beat the current record of 12 days. Russel’s journey will take him through Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Botswana, before eventually arriving home in Cape Town. Russell arrived in the Egyptian capital Cairo on Tuesday and is currently touring Cairo and his myriad tourist attractions before beginning his arduous trek at the crack of dawn on Sunday. He is expected to arrive at the Esheet-Qustul border-crossing between Egypt and Sudan the same day, thereby completing the first-leg of his trip. Egyptian press attaché Ayman Walash says reviving the corridor between Cairo and Cape Town is in the interests of both countries as the route promotes regional integration, facilitates transport and intra-African trade, as well as boosting tourism in Africa.
