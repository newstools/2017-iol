CARDIFF - South Africa coach Allister Coetzee believes it will be a sign of the Springboks' “massive improvement” if they beat Wales in their final Test of 2017. Coetzee's men will be aiming to avoid a third successive defeat by Wales when they run out at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Saturday.
South Africa, one of rugby union's traditional major powers, suffered a humiliating 38-3 loss to Ireland in Dublin three weeks ago but have since beaten France and Italy while in Europe. “I am really satisfied with the progress shown this year, which has been massive compared to this time last year,” Coetzee told reporters on Friday.
“The players have grown, there is a lot of cohesion and the evolution has been satisfactory. If we could finish the tour with three wins, it would show a massive improvement,” the under-pressure coach added. “Ireland were too good for us on the night and played an excellent kicking game. We learnt from that and pulled through against France, and we were clinical against Italy. We have to take it one step further this weekend. “The team is completely different from Cardiff last year, the team environment has changed a hell of a lot and our processes are in place with a clear understanding of how we want to play.   Meanwhile South Africa captain Eben Etzebeth insisted: “If you play for, or coach, the Boks, there is always going to be pressure.
“The whole rugby-mad nation is looking at you, and tomorrow's game is going to be another pressure Test. We are looking forward to it.” The lock added: “We always look at our scrum as a weapon. We're a set-piece team, we like scrummaging, the mauling battle. We don't care who we are playing out there, we always go for them at scrums, mauls and line-outs.” AFP    Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
