Tamar Braxton is divorcing Vince Herbert. The 'Love and War' singer has announced she will be splitting from the 44-year-old songwriter - with whom she shares four-year-old son Logan - after nearly nine years of marriage. Her representative said in a statement: "At this time we can confirm Ms. Braxton has made an extremely difficult decision and has filed for divorce from Vincent Herbert. Pearl Thusi & DJ Zinhle epitomise BFF goals at #SAFW "Collectively, their son Logan and his well-being during this extremely unfortunate process is most important. We ask that everyone respects her privacy during this incredibly difficult time. She appreciates everyone’s love and prayers." It comes after Tamar admitted it was "really hard" working so close with her husband, who is also the manager of her music career, and contemplated leaving her recording career behind to save her relationship.
