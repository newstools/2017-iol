Here are a few tips from Babylonstoren’s master gardener Gundula Deutschlander to help you on the décor front. Get prepped and potted Whether you’re a newbie or a veteran gardener, add a few extra potted plants to your stoep or outside garden. Decorate with fruits and vegetables Use brightly coloured veg such as beetroot and large spinach leaves. Lemons, limes, and mint are great for visual and aromatic inspiration! Turn on the brights Festive, colourful accessories are a great way to shout: “ Let’s celebrate!” So do hang colourful bunting in the trees or on the patio. And also give tired garden furniture a lick of paint in a bright colour and scatter colourful cushions and blankets on the lawn for guests to relax on. For even the most botanically incompetent, terrariums are super easy to make and incredibly low-maintenance. They work well as table decorations and gifts for your guests. Invited guests only Once you’ve prepared a delicious spread don’t forget to protect it and guests from bugs and mosquitoes by using beautifully decorated hanging nets or a “shoo-fly” cover over food. Citronella candles in various containers will assist in this department. Independent on Saturday
