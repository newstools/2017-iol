Kiev - The father of a murder victim detonated two hand
grenades in a courtroom in the Ukrainian city of Nikopol on Thursday
and died in the explosion, police said. At least seven others present at the trial, including the accused,
were injured, police added in a statement. The suspect stands accused of killing the man's son and one other
person after shooting at a car they were in with an automatic weapon
in 2016. Since the outbreak of war in eastern Ukraine in 2014, thousands of
weapons have become available on the black market.  dpa
