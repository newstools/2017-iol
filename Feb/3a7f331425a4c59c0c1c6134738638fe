Winnipeg - On Bay Street, Toronto’s equivalent of Wall Street, you
can now buy weed. Rather, make that "WEED." Amid what it says is
a growing acceptance of Canada’s burgeoning medical-marijuana industry, Canopy
Growth, switched to the new four-letter stock ticker on the Toronto Stock
Exchange Wednesday. “We’re thrilled to be marketing WEED on Bay Street,”
CEO Bruce Linton said in a statement. Smiths Falls, Ontario-based Canopy became Canada’s first
marijuana unicorn when its market capitalization surpassed $1 billion last
year. It currently has a valuation of C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion). The company
has yet to post a net profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The value of marijuana stocks in Canada has swelled as
shareholders bet on the legalization of recreational use. The government has
promised to introduce the necessary legislation in 2017, which would make it
the first among the Group of Seven Nations to do so. If legalisation occurs
along expected timelines, there could be 3.8 million recreational users and the
potential for C$6 billion of sales, Canaccord Genuity analysts said in a
November note. Canopy shares have more than tripled in the past 12
months. They were up 3.6 percent at C$10.20 at 11:10 a.m. in Toronto. Bloomberg
