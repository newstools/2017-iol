New Delhi Â - Indian budget airline SpiceJet will purchase 205
planes worth 22 billion dollars from US manufacturer Boeing, one of
the biggest orders ever made by an Indian airline, according to an
agreement announced Friday. The deal includes 100 new 737 Max 8 jets, builds upon an existing order for 55 aircraft, SpiceJet said in a statement. The
airline also has purchase rights for 50 additional jets. "With this, the total order of 205 aircraft is valued at 22 billion
dollars ... at list prices," SpiceJet said in an emailed statement. The airline was on the verge of closure two years ago as it was
making heavy losses. "Our turnaround story has been one which has very few parallels in
the world today and we are proud of it," SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh
said. The agreement also provided a big boost for Boeing in India. Its
rival, European aircraft producer Airbus, has won record deals from
Indian airlines in recent months. Last July, Indian budget airline GoAir signed an agreement to buy 72
single-aisle aircraft from Airbus for 7.7 billion dollars at list
prices. Previously in 2015, another budget airline, IndiGo finalized a deal
to purchase 250 single-aisle jets from Airbus, in a deal then
estimated at 26.55 billion dollars. DPA
