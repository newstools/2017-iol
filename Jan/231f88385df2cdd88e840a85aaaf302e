Johannesburg The Gauteng Department of Health on Friday warned the public not to fall victims to scammers who are fraudulently inviting people to apply for nursing, porting and general vacancies at the Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital (DGMAH) in Pretoria. Spokesperson Steve Mabona said it has been brought to their attention that there was an advertisements circulating claiming to come from the human resources coordinator of the department. &quot;When people call the contacts on the advert they are then asked to deposit R2 000 into a retail store in exchange for employment. We want to state firmly that vacancies in the public service are not for sale,&quot; said Mabona. MEC for Health, Qedani Mahlangu, condemned the exploitation and told people to be aware. We condemn those who exploit people s desperation for employment for their own devious ends. We plead with community members not pay money for jobs in any of our facilities. Anyone approached for job in exchange for money should report that to the police, said Mahlangu. African News Agency
