The report, “Making Progress Towards Attaining the Sustainable Development Goals in Africa", draws on the insights cultivated from the APP’s work over the past decade and outlines the key opportunities and challenges Africa faces as it strives to realise sustainable development goals and create long-term equitable and sustainable prosperity. The APP’s final report is primarily a call to action, and presents a bold agenda for African progress. Three core priorities for action highlighted in the final panel report are: mobilise sufficient financial resources fast for Africa’s “green and blue” (agriculture and fisheries sector) revolutions, rapidly boost investment in Africa’s energy and transport infrastructure, and fight against illicit financial activities. - BUSINESS REPORT
