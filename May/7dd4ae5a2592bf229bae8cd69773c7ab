Paris – It’s midlife manicure time for the Peugeot 308, and that means a redesigned front end, some added gadgets and new engines in the upper range. Very little changes stylistically inside the 308’s cabin, but the touch-screen command centre does gain a new 3D navigation system as well as updated graphics and a Mirror Screen function that duplicates your smartphone. The latter is compatible with Android Auto and Apple Carplay. The 308 also gains the latest generation of Peugeot’s driver assistance systems as per the new 3008 SUV, these including Visiopark with 180-degree rear camera and Active Safety Brake. Furthermore, It’s the first PSA product to get cruise control with a stop function, although this only applies to auto models – manuals have a 30km/h function. On the engine front, Peugeot has upgraded the 96kW 1.2-litre three-cylinder turbopetrol PureTech engine for better combustion efficiency and there’s a brand new 96kW four-cylinder turbodiesel engine. At the upper end of the range, Peugeot’s 132kW BlueHDi 180 S&S motor is now mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Exterior styling changes, as you’ll see above, are hardly radical, but there is a bigger and more vertical grille as well as a redesigned bumper and new, albeit similarly-shaped headlights, with an LED light signature on all models. Peugeot talks of new rear lights too, with a three-claw light signature, but we’ll have to imagine that for now as Peugeot has only as yet released a single frontal image of the car. Peugeot SA tells us that the updated hatch is likely to reach local shores around February next year. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
