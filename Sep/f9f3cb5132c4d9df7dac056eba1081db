Ingredients For the apricot & rosemary butter you’ll need: 2 tbsp. fresh rosemary needles 2 cloves garlic; chopped 50 g Padkos Turkish apricots; roughly chopped 1 tsp. fresh ginger; chopped 100 g soft butter Salt and freshly ground black pepper For the yellowtail you’ll need: 1 whole yellowtail; butterflied (use snoek as an alternative) 1 ripe lemon Closed braai grid Salt and freshly ground black pepper Method Place all the ingredients, except the butter, into a food processor and chop finely. Now add the butter and blend together. Place the fish skin down onto a braai grid. Squeeze the lemon juice onto the flesh and season with a little salt and pepper. Now spread half of the apricot & rosemary butter onto the fish. Close the grid and place the fish skin down onto the hot grill. You need to keep an eye on the fish and cook it on the skin side first. As the flesh starts to turn opaque, turn over to finish and cook until the top browns.
Remove from the grid and place onto a wooden board or platter. Spread the remaining butter onto the fish and serve with extra lemon wedges. Tip: When choosing your fish allow for about 300–350 g per person taking into account that the bones and head add to the weight of the fish.
