Pretoria - Government has approved the transfer of funds from the National Revenue Fund to SAA to prevent the airline defaulting on its debts to Citibank. Funds will also be used to assist SAA with its immediate working capital requirements. The Treasury said in a statement that payment was made in terms of section 16 of the Public Finance Management Act. This allows the Finance Minister to use funds to defray expenditure of an exceptional nature which is currently not provided for and which cannot, without serious prejudice to the public interest, be postponed to a future Parliamentary appropriation of funds. A default by the airline on the R3 billion loan would have triggered a call on the guarantee exposure of R16.4 billion, leading to an outflow from the National Revenue Fund and possibly resulting in elevated perceptions of risk related to the rest of SAA's guaranteed debt. The treasury said the appointment of Vuyani Jarana as Chief Executive Officer from November 1, marks a critical step in ensuring that the airline's turnaround strategy is implemented. Further appointments to other critical executive positions will follow. The Treasury said that it viewed the airline as a strategic asset and in its role as the flag carrier, it serves as an economic enabler with direct and indirect benefits across a wide range of economic activity. The Democratic Alliance said it was disappointed, but not surprised, that Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba resorted to once again raiding the National Revenue Fund of at least R3 billion to settle part of SAA's debt. It noted that the SAA bailout for this year was R5.2 billion. "While the latest lifeboat will keep the wolves at bay, it will not deal decisively with the funding crisis at SAA, as the airline is currently incurring R350 million in losses every month," it said.
