JOHANNESBURG – Sale Sharks-bound Faf de Klerk has missed out on selection to the Lions team for the second week in a row as coach Johan Ackermann made five changes to the side that beat the Rebels last week for Friday’s match against the Brumbies.  De Klerk has again been overlooked by Ackermann who’s opted to start with Ross Cronje, with Dillon Smit on the bench.  It is believed the 11-cap Springbok De Klerk is headed to the Sharks in England at the end of the current season. The Lions have however yet to confirm the move.  In other changes to the side that beat the Rebels a week ago, Corne Fourie, Johannes Jonker and Robbie Coetzee make up a new front row, while Andries Ferreira returns at lock and so, too, does Ruan Ackermann at flank.  The backline remains unchanged.  A final call on who the back-up loose forward will be will be taken later in the week, with Ackermann having to decide between Robert Kruger and Cyle Brink.  The Lions are hunting a third straight bonus-point win on tour after earlier getting the better of the Rebels and Western Force.  Kickoff is at 11.45am (SA time) on Friday. Lions team: Andries Coetzee, Sylvian Mahuza, Lionel Mapoe, Harold Vorster, Courtnall Skosan, Elton Jantjies, Ross Cronje, Warren Whiteley (capt), Ruan Ackermann, Kwagga Smith, Franco Mostert, Andries Ferreira, Johannes Jonker, Robbie Coetzee, Corne Fourie. Replacements: Malcolm Marx, Jacques van Rooyen, Ruan Dreyer, Lourens Erasmus, Robert Kruger/Cyle Brink, Dillon Smit, Jacques Nel, Anthony Volmink Independent Media     Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
