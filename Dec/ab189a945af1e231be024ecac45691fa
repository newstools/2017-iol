Pretoria - Ford South Africa has given its locally-built Ranger line-up a slight tweak for 2018, with an expanded Fx4 range, the availability of front park assist and a factory-fitted bed-liner option. The Fx4 styling package, which was launched earlier this year as a limited edition model based on the 3.2 double cab XLT 4x4, is now available with a wider range of derivatives, including 2.2-litre manual and auto models. The Fx4 is set apart by numerous black finishes applied to the wheels, grille, mirrors, roof rails, sports bar and side steps among other items. Furthermore, the Fx4, along with the XLT upon which it is based, is now fitted with frontal park assist as standard. These models already came with a reverse camera, forming part of the standard Sync3 infotainment system. Finally, Ford is also offering a sprayed-on polyurea-based bed-liner as a factory fitted option for the first time. IOL Motoring
