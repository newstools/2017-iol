LAGOS - At least seven football fans were killed and 11 injured when an electric cable fell on a building where they were watching a Europa League football match, Nigerian police said Friday. The incident happened in the southern port city of Calabar on Thursday during a quarter-final clash between Manchester United and Anderlecht being shown on satellite television, the local police said. "We received a report of the incident around 10:00 pm and on getting there were able to recover the bodies of seven people who had been electrocuted when a high tension cable fell on them," Cross River state police spokeswoman Irene Ugbo told AFP. "Eleven other fans who were injured were rushed to the hospital, with one in a critical condition," she said. Local media reported that up to 30 fans were feared dead in the incident. Ugbo has ruled out any foul play in the tragedy. AFP
