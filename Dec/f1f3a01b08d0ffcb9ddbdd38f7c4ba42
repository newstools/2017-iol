The holidays are here and they bring with them a wonderful opportunity for families to spend time together, laugh, be silly and enjoy activities together. Cindy Glass, the co-founder and director of after school remediation franchise, Step Up Education Centre, shares some tips on how to connect with your child this holiday season:  Create a sense of excitement within the family: Have something to look forward to. Choose to make this holiday one of family connection. Remember, what you give to others, you give to yourself. Encourage tolerance, love and peace by being tolerant, loving and peaceful yourself. Listen without judgement:  Holidays provide a great opportunity to stop and listen.  Your children want connection as much as anyone on the planet and being heard is essential in achieving this. Ask questions about each other’s lives. Let your children teach you about their passions and interests, you may just be in awe of how your children view life. So often children shut the doors of communication for fear of how their parents will react. If connection is your goal, listen without judgement. Expect challenges: Being human means that things can, and will, go awry from time to time. Allow for these moments. Own them when they happen and find positive solutions. There is, after all, a solution for every challenge! It is how each family member chooses to react to challenges that will make or break your holiday. Be prepared: If you are travelling and you know that boredom could lead to a less than desirable journey, make sure that you are well-prepared with exciting treats and some games to play in the car! Some old favourites like ‘I spy, 20 questions and adding numbers up on licence plates’ can keep little people entertained for hours!
