Toronto Auto Show – Top to bottom, inside and out, Hyundai’s all-new Accent, revealed in Canada on Thursday night, is pretty much the evolution you would have expected from the Korean carmaker’s compact sedan. The shape has a familiarity about it, yet it’s grown in length and width and has a more mature appearance thanks to its straighter creases. Front and rear it resembles the latest Elantra, except that the grille now takes on the so-called cascading theme pioneered by the new i30 hatch. Inside there’s a lot of latest-generation Tucson going on, with a sober but functional design that incorporates a 17.8cm touch-screen infotainment system which features the latest in smart-phone pairing in the form of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The only engine mentioned at the reveal is a revised direct injection normally aspirated 1.6-litre petrol unit, rated at 98kW and 161Nm. It’s mated to either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic gearbox. Expect a more refined feel thanks to an improved chassis and stiffer structure that uses 13 percent more high-strength steel, meaning passive safety will be improved too. We’re currently awaiting confirmation on when the new compact sedan is due to reach South African shores. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
