Africa’s very first Radisson RED – a fresh and unique hotel culture inspired by all things art, music and fashion – has appointed Dale Simpson as Curator and leader of Cape Town’s newest hotel concept, set to shake up the local hospitality scene in the third quarter of 2017. In the hotel industry, a General Manager is traditionally the individual tasked with the overall responsibility of an establishment’s operations.

Born and raised in Bushmills, Northern Ireland, Simpson attended Napier University, where he completed his Honours in Tourism Management, followed by a master’s degree in Human Resource Management. He began his career with the Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group in 2009, and during his time within the prestigious group, Simpson has taken on a variety of roles, ranging from General Manager to Food and Drink Director for the group’s corporate support office in Brussels. In his role as Curator at Radisson RED Hotel V&A Waterfront, Cape Town he will be running the show and driving the REDvolution through passion and innovation.
