Conakry, the capital of the Republic of Guinea, became the 296th destination in 120 countries that will be served by Turkish Airlines. This adds yet another city and country to the carrier’s African network which now serves 51 destinations on the continent, more African destinations than any other carrier. Turkish Airlines is investing heavily in their expansion into Africa. In South Africa it now has year-round, daily direct flights from Cape Town and Johannesburg to Istanbul, and travels to Istanbul from Durban via Johannesburg 5 times a week. Roundtrip flights between Istanbul and Conakry will be operated twice a  week on Mondays and Thursdays in both directions. Conakry joins a widening destination portfolio in West Africa that include city–hubs of Accra, Abuja, Bamako, Dakar, Abidjan, Cotonou, Douala, Yaounde, N’Djamena, Ougadougou and Niamey. Kenan Ince, General Manager for Turkish Airlines in South Africa said this Conakry service will provide a link between Istanbul Atatürk Airport and the Conakry International Airport via Ouagadougou. He added that the return flight will give passengers departing Guinea, access to global destinations such as London, Dubai, Paris, Frankfurt, and Cape Town and Johannesburg. “Our investment in Africa has been a strong element of our strategy in recent years. Turkish Airlines flies to more destinations in Africa than any other airline. “Between January 2016 and December 2017, capacity between Cape Town and Istanbul was increased by 30 percent. Since December last year, Turkish Airlines has also been flying to Havana, Cuba three times a week, giving South Africans one of the best value offers on this route,” he said.
