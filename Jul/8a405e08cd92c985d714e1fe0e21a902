Whether you’ve got a date or maybe you’ve just looked in the mirror and saw a drab, tired face looking back at you this radiance-boosting mask will help give you a little extra sparkle and help you on your way to your glow-up. Ingredients: One minced yellow or red pepper,  one egg white, one teaspoon sour cream. The pepper can boost microcirculation, egg white tightens the skin and sour cream contains lactic acid that can gently exfoliate the dull, dead layers of your skin to reveal a brighter-looking complexion. Method: Mix all ingredients together and apply the mixture to clean, dry skin, avoiding the eye area. Leave it on for about 15-20 minutes. Rinse off with warm water and then again with cool water immediately afterwards. READ:Always remember to wash your make up brushes Rehydrating Mask
