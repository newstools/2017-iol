Makes 24 to 30 pieces This creamy sweet confection first appeared in the 1950 edition of "Betty Crocker's Picture Cook Book." Chopped pecans are typically mixed in, but we've used dried cranberries instead for a festive Christmas touch. You'll need an instant-read or candy thermometer.
The divinity can be stored between sheets of wax paper in an airtight container at room temperature for a week or two; it will become chewier over time. Ingredients 2 large egg whites 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup light corn syrup 2 cups sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt (optional) 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup dried cranberries, chopped Method Line two baking sheets with wax paper. Beat the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer (paddle attachment) or use a handheld electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. Combine the water, corn syrup, sugar and salt, if using, in a large saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Cook, without stirring, for 8 to 10 minutes or until the temperature of the mixture registers 250 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. While the egg whites are being beaten on high speed, gradually add the syrup mixture. Beat for a total of 9 or 10 minutes, or until stiff peaks form. The surface of the meringue mixture will turn from glossy to textured. Use a spatula to fold in the vanilla extract and dried cranberries by hand, then quickly create 24 to 30 rounded teaspoonfuls on the baking sheets. Let stand for about 30 minutes, or until completely set, before serving or storing. Adapted from "Betty Crocker Lost Recipes: Beloved Vintage Recipes for Today's Kitchen"
