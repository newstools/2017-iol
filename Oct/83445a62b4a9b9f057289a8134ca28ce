It seems all is not well in the Fast and Furious family following the recent announcement that the movie release date has been delayed by a year. The ninth installment of the popular franchise was initially due to be released in April 2019 but executives at Universal announced it will now be released on April 10, 2020. Reasons for the delays are unknown but it seems actor and singer Tyrese Gibson may have an idea. Gibson took to Instagram on Thursday, accusing his co-star, Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock for holding up the next installment of the franchise. A post shared by TYRESE (@tyrese) on Oct 4, 2017 at 8:29pm PDT “Congratulations to @TheRock and your brother in law aka 7 bucks producing partner @hhgarcia41 for making the fast and the furious franchise about YOU - And like you, DJ even if they call I will not be deleting this post - Gn folks see you in 2020 April #FastFamily right? Nah..... it's about #TeamDewayne #3yrs will it be worth the wait? #NoShaw just Hobbs will this be another #BayWatch? Guys guys just relax I'm just a passionate film critic,” he wrote. Fast and Furious 9 delayed to 2020 Gibson who is known for his role as Roman Pearce in the movie franchise, later posted another lengthy statement with an old image of the Fast and Furious cast. “Diversity, love, multi ethnic worldwide multi generational, United Nations, One Race, Fast Family......
