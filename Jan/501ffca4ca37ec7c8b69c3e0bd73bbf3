#PickOfTheSession : Friday is leg day!! I haven't perfected my Free Squating but it's a good start. This exercise is for fuller glutes a.k.a bigger booty🍑 and yummy legs! I used a 20KG Olympic bar with 10KG weight on each side. 6 sets of 10. 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 Love you, @bronwyndean27. 😘 #SexyBodyMissions👙 #BTS💪🏾 #BeYourOwnBodyGoal #OwnYourThrone👑 A video posted by Boitumelo Thulo (@boity) on Jan 19, 2017 at 11:24pm PST #PickOfTheSession : #RussianTwists with a 7KG weight (or more if you're up for it), 4 sets of 20.

Without me even asking, @bronwyndean27 went out of her way to buy and prepare these meals for me because she understands how hectic my schedule can get. Now I don't have to stress about getting my diet right each day. Thank you so so much, Bron. You are a solid gem! 😭😭🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️✨✨ #FightForYourHealth #BTS💪🏾 #OwnYourThrone👑 A photo posted by Boitumelo Thulo (@boity) on Jan 15, 2017 at 10:47pm PST IOL
