JOHANNESBURG - International brewer Heineken Holding on Monday laid the foundation stone of its first brewery in Mozambique, a $100 million investment which incorporates the latest technologies. Located in the province of Maputo, between the Marracuene and Manhiça districts, the brewery will have a production capacity of 0.8 million hectoliters and will brew high quality beers for the domestic market. The first bottle of beer is expected to come off the production line in the first half of 2019. Heineken Mozambique started its activities in 2016 through a sales and marketing office, importing international beers including Heineken, Amstel, Amstel Lite and Sagres in the country to offer more choice to Mozambican consumers. With this significant investment, Heineken Mozambique is expected to create 200 direct jobs and support additional indirect jobs through its entire value chain. Heineken Mozambique said it would explore the possibility of locally sourcing the raw materials it will need to produce its beers, aligned with its ambition of sourcing 60 percent of its agricultural raw materials in Africa by 2020. One of the objectives of this project will be to improve crop yields, as well as the capabilities and living standards of Mozambican farmers, contributing to the economic development of the country. Boudewijn Haarsma, Heineken International's managing director east and west Africa, said they see promising long-term economic perspectives.  "The project is progressing well thanks to the support of the Mozambican government and its commitment to bring investments into the country," Haarsma said.  "Investing in a new market like Mozambique supports Heineken's ambition to expand its footprint and be the number one or a strong number two in all markets in which it operates." Nuno Simes, Heineken Mozambique's general manager said they were looking forward "to continue to provide enjoyment to Mozambican consumers with our brands". - AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY
