But the former Bruce Jenner – now Caitlyn Jenner after becoming a transgender woman – says she works harder at her makeup than she ever did at winning gold. Writing in her new autobio-graphy, serialised in British You magazine, Jenner said: “Applying makeup is always intense and I sometimes think I work harder on it than I did to win the decathlon.” She also reveals how she stole clothes and make-up from her now ex-wife Kris, and her daughters and stepdaughters, including Kim Kardashian. Jenner, 67, recalls a speech in Florida: “They know what they want to hear: a life defined by those two days at the Olympic stadium when I broke the world record. “They don’t know that underneath the dark blue business suit, I am wearing panties, a bra and tights.”  – Mail on Sunday
