When doing a closet clean out – be mindful of what you aren’t wearing anymore and why. Perhaps a certain brand, a certain colour, a certain style – to prevent you buying similar things again. Get dirty Pull all your clothing out, vacuum any cobwebs or insects in the hard-to-reach places (nothing worse than knowing you have bugs nibbling on your beautiful clothing) and wipe out the cupboard, including the underneath of the shelves as they get damp or marked with use. Make sure the shelf is DRY before putting any clothes back inside. No more damp Replace your damp absorber and mark it with the new date. You can get these at the hardware store. Check for stains When going through each piece, check to see if the items need to be washed to prevent long-term stains – with our humid climate closets are damp and clothes may grow mildew on them . Donate any unworn items to charity. Make a note It’s a good time to make note of any items you have borrowed or lent and return them or get them back. Wash, wash Give all your swimsuits a wash – that way they are fresh for the summer. Underwear If they have holes, they smell, are stained, are all stretched, they are no longer the original colour or shape – time to go!! Check your shoes Do they need to be re-healed, cleaned or mended? Jiggle all your shoes to make sure you haven’t dropped an earring or small items in the bottom of your closet. Think ahead Unpack and wash any beach bags, getting rid of any sand and damp, to be stored for next season. Hang it up Hang all hangers back to front for the next season…. all hangers still facing you. At the end of winter it means you haven’t worn the item and it’s time to donate. DIY time This is a good time to fix any shelves that have come loose or door hinges that need tightening – to prevent further, more costly damage down the road. * Bryony Parr is a professional organiser.
