Kevin Hart isn’t “phased” by hate comments. The 38-year-old actor took to Instagram on Wednesday,  to share a photo of his pregnant wife Eniko Parrish, and whilst he said he was “lucky” to be married to the beauty, he also took a moment to slam his critics, saying he’s too “strong” to be affected by negativity. He captioned the professional snap: “Thanking God for this beautiful strong woman that I am lucky enough to still be calling my wife today. You are truly amazing....Love you. #WCW#WCE#MyFuckingRib #Harts ....P.S please feel free to insert your hate below.... "Im as strong as it gets people so that s**t doesn't phase me. Im not a b***h which is why my page isn't private. I hope your negativity makes your day better. Love ya (sic)”  Thanking God for this beautiful strong woman that I am lucky enough to still be calling my wife today.

The ‘Central Intelligence’ actor - who also has children Heaven, 12, and Hendrix, nine, with ex-wife Torrei - previously revealed the extortion plot when he sent "many apologies" to his wife and children in an emotional Instagram post, in which he discussed his "mistakes" and claimed there was someone trying to make "financial gain" from his past antics. Part of his lengthy post read: “I made a bad error in judgement and I put myself in a bad environment where only bad things can happen and they did. And in doing that I know that I'm going to hurt the people closest to me, who've I talked to and made apologies to, that would be my wife and my kids. "And I just, you know, it's a s***ty moment. It's a s***ty moment when you know you're wrong and there's no excuses. "At the end of the day man, I just simply have got to do better. But I'm also not going to allow a person to have financial gain off of my mistakes and in this particular situation that was what was attempted. I said I'd rather fess up to my mistakes." Bang Showbiz
