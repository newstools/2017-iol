Amman - US President Donald Trump phoned
Jordan's King Abdullah on Tuesday and told him he intends to go
ahead with a decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to
Jerusalem, a Jordanian palace statement said. King Abdullah was quoted in the statement as telling Trump
that such a decision would have "dangerous repercussions on the
stability and security of the region" and would obstruct US efforts to resume Arab-Israeli peace talks. It would also inflame Muslim and Christian feelings, the
king added. US endorsement of Israel's claim to all of Jerusalem as
its capital would break with decades of U.S. policy that the
city's status must be decided in negotiations with the
Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future state. The international community does not recognize Israeli
sovereignty over the entire city. King Abdullah warned Trump of the risks of any decision that
ran counter to a final settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict
based on the creation of an independent Palestinian state with
its capital in East Jerusalem. "Jerusalem is the key to achieving peace and stability in
the region and the world," the palace statement said. The monarch also phoned Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas
and said they had to both work together to "confront the
consequences of this decision." King Abdullah's Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the
Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any
changes of status of the disputed city.Â   Reuters
