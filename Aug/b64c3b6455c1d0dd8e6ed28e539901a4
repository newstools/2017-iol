Johannesburg - Outspoken ANC MP Makhosi Khoza has been removed as the chairperson of Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Public Service and Administration.  
 
ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said on Thursday that the decision to remove Khoza came from the ANC after failed attempts to rein her in on her "behaviour". 
 
"The erosion of trust in her as a chairperson has also led to acrimonious verbal exchanges between her and members of the study group in meetings and on social media," said Mthembu. 
 
ANC MPs who were unhappy with Khoza boycotted a session of the committee on Tuesday, citing their unhappiness with being led by Khoza as the reason. Only one ANC MP attended the session. 
 
The same MPs also wrote to Mthembu asking him to remove Khoza. Mthembu said Khoza had been informed of the decision to remove her. "We have since communicated this decision to comrade Khoza. She is released from her position of chairperson with immediate effect. She remains an ANC member of parliament pending the outcomes of disciplinary action taken against her by the organisation," said Mthembu. 
 
She had been appointed in the position a few months ago, and is facing disciplinary action in KwaZulu-Natal for speaking against President Jacob Zuma. “The irretrievable breakdown of relations arises from her public utterances preceding the motion of no confidence vote in President Jacob Zuma and her continued public attacks on ANC leadership and members of her ANC caucus who voted against the motion on August 8,” said ANC caucus spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli. “Comrade Khoza’s continued public attacks have led to her alienating ANC members of parliament including those in her committee resulting in an ill-advised and out-of-line decision to boycott any activity she is involved in,” she said. “The erosion of trust in her as a chairperson has also led to acrimonious verbal exchanges between her and members of the study group in meetings and on social media,” she added.
