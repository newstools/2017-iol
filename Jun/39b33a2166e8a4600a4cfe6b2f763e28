Lusikisiki - President Jacob Zuma has "made an undertaking" to the community of Lusikisiki and surrounding areas in the Eastern Cape that government at all three levels will intensify the delivery of basic services to the people and also ensure decisive action against crime, the presidency said on Saturday. Zuma paid a "Siyahlola presidential monitoring visit" to Lusikisiki on Saturday, the presidency said in a statement. Zuma began his visit by taking a guided tour of the new Lusikisiki police station. "We believe that this new police station will make a significant contribution to our fight to reduce crime in this community and defeat the scourge, particularly of gangsterism, in the form of 'Amavondo', about which I have received a number of complaints," he said. Zuma then proceeded to the community engagement part of his visit where community members voiced their grievances and also provided suggestions.
