Somewhere in South Africa – This is the latest official preview video of the upcoming Volkswagen Polo, which is expected to debut at the Frankfurt motor show in September. It shows a camouflaged test mule on test in the arid South African Karoo, and highlights that the new Polo is based on the MQB A0 platform, and that it’s the successor to more than 14 million of this family sold since 1975. As we already know, the new Polo will be offered in Europe in a range including two versions of the new 1.5-litre TSI turbopetrol, two version of the existing one-litre three-cylinder petrol engine and at least two versions of the 1.6-litre TDI turbodiesel – and of course, the range topping GTI will have the two-litre TSI from the previous Golf GTI.
