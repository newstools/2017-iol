Cape Town – Just what does it take to set a new production-car lap record of 6m52.01 at the Nurburgring? It takes a limited-edition Lamborghini Huracan Performante, that’s what. It takes a 5.2-litre V10 uprated with titanium valves, revised intake plumbing and a lighter, freer-flowing exhaust system, delivering 470kW at 8000 revs and 600Nm at 6500rpm to the rear wheels via a re-programmed seven speed double-clutch transmission. It takes active aerodynamics, constantly resetting movable flaps in the splitter and the rear wing for maximum downforce under braking and through corners, and minimum drag under acceleration and on the straights. It takes a new generation of magnetic adaptive damping that adjusts itself in real time, not only to terrain and acceleration but also to your driving style, by measuring the rate of change of accelerator, braking and steering inputs. And it takes a 40kg weight saving over the standard Huracan, thanks to special lightweight rims, carbon-fibre seats, alcantara synthetic suede trim and a whole new way of using carbon flakes rather than fibres to make ultra-strong, rigid composite components – a process using pressures so high that Lamborghini calls them ‘forged composites’ – for the the front and rear spoilers and the cabin trim. Coming to a Lambo dealer near you – no, really But what’s more important is that it takes R5 835 500; that’s the projected price of the Huracan Performante when it arrives – along with a second, as yet unspecified new model from Sant’Agata – in the new Lamborghini showrooms in Durban and Cape Town, to be opened later this year by South African distributor Imperial Collection.
