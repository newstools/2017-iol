Johannesburg - Department of Home Affairs director-generalÂ Mkuseli Apleni has been suspended, the department announced on Monday. In a terse statement, the department confirmed that the minister, Professor Hlengiwe Mkhize, had placed Apleni on precautionary suspension, effective from September 18, 2017. It remains unclear why Apleni was suspended as the department provided no reasons for the move. Apleni's tenure as Home Affairs DG has not been without controversy, with the department having come under fire after it emerged that former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba had granted the Gupta family citizenship, despite a senior official having previously turned down the request. This is a developing story. IOL
