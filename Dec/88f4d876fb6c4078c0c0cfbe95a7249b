The De Zalze Murders by Julian Jansen (Tafelberg) The Van Bredas looked like the perfect family - wealthy, successful and well-connected, living a seemingly picture-perfect life at the upmarket De Zalze estate in Stellenbosch. But one night in January 2015 this all came to a bloody end when three of the family members were brutally axed to death. Marli, the teenage daughter, suffered amnesia from the trauma and has no recollection of the horrific night. Henri is the only person who knows what happened. Suspected of the triple murder, he has  tried to prove his innocence in court - leaving the country to speculate as to whether it was him who wielded the axe against his own family.  Hap by Lesley Beake (Tafelberg)  Lucy, 16, from New York, is recovering from a recent, traumatic experience and, when she  joins her father in South Africa at the fictional West Coast town of Barclay Bay, she attempts to make sense of her ordeal. But she is deeply affected by those around here, present and past. Hap, an early ancestor, makes a deep impact on Lucy in her heightened sense of emotion and perception.
