SAN FRANCISCO - Twitter has announced that it will be testing a new feature called Bookmarks. Bookmarks will allow users to privately save tweets for later. Staff product designer Tina Koyama tweeted a sneak peek into what the feature looks like, with a bookmarks option listed on the users’ navigation menu. “We went through all the designed flows and picked the ones that are the easiest to navigate to test out with our community,” she tweeted. “You told us that you want tweets you’ve bookmarked to be private, so only you can see it. We kept this in mind while creating designs for the feature.” A previous demo shows how the bookmark function might work: users hit on the corner button of a tweet, a menu pops out and an “add to Bookmarks” option appears. The company’s head of product Keith Coleman had tweeted about the function in October. Coleman had said that the feature has been a top request from users on the social-networking site. Presently, if you do want to save a tweet, the only way you can is to hit the like button as a way to save a tweet. There is no official release date for the Bookmark feature as of yet.    - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
