Renault-owned Dacia has released the first pictures of its redesigned Duster ahead of the vehicle’s scheduled world debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show on September 12. The Duster is sold as a Renault in most markets, including ours, and Renault SA tells us that the new version is likely to land on our shores during the second half of 2018. But just how new is it exactly? Though the styling is clearly evolutionary, and the basic design language sticks to the familiar, the affordable SUV has undergone a complete redesign and boasts a cleaner and dare we say slightly more mature look than before. Exterior design highlights include satin-chrome-finished skid plates, new aluminium roof bars and stacked-square taillights. The second-generation Duster also has more interior space, with the windscreen having been brought forward by 100mm. 
The cabin also boasts a completely new design, but we’ll have to take Renault’s word on that for now as the interior will only be revealed in Frankfurt, when Renault will also no doubt reveal all the other details such as features, and engines. Watch this space on September 12. IOL Motoring
