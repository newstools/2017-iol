Centre Shaun Treeby of the Stormers has been cited for alleged foul play during the 30-22 victory over the Blues at Newlands on Friday night. Treeby is alleged to have contravened Law 10.4(e) Dangerous tackling of an Opponent when he put in a high shot on Blues flyhalf Piers Francis in the 47th minute. Referee Jaco van Heerden just awarded a penalty, but upon further review of the match footage, the citing commissioner deemed in his opinion the incident had met the red card threshold for foul play. The case is to be considered in the first instance by the SANZAAR Foul Play Review Committee which will take place on Sunday. All SANZAAR disciplinary matters are in the first instance referred to the Foul Play Review Committee to provide the option of expediting the judicial process. For a matter to be dispensed with at this hearing, the person appearing must plead guilty and accept the penalty offered by the Foul Play Review Committee.
