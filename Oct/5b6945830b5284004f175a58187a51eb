Las Vegas - Hyundai is known for bringing a generous assortment of beefy creations to the SEMA show in Las Vegas and this year is proving to be no exception. In addition to the BTR Edition Elantra Sport that it announced last week, the Korean carmaker has teamed up with Ohio-based tuner Vaccar to give its Tucson SUV a brawny makeover for the upcoming show. This one also seems to have the performance currency to cash the cheques that the brash bodykit writes, thanks to a Boostec turbocharger, Mishimoto G-Line intercooler, R50 blow-off valve, AEM air intake system and charge pipe kit, Vaccar front-mount piping and cat-back exhaust and Magnaflow performance mufflers. That said, Hyundai has yet to tell us how much power it makes or how fast it is. The Tucson concept rides on 20-inch Concept One alloys and a Vaccar-Gecko G-Street coilover suspension system, and features a Vaccar-Power Z23 Evolution brake kit. Lowered to the point of not actually being an SUV anymore, the Sin City special also gets a two-tone paint job along with a Vaccar front lip, mesh grille, side skirts and rear diffuser. Inside it sports Ice Grey leather with blue stitching, a Vaccar 23cm multimedia system with WiFi and some serious sound upgrades in the form of a Nano 520w Class D 4ch Amplifier and a Picasso 30.4cm powered subwoofer enclosure.
