Rafael Nadal slugged his way into the Wimbledon last 16 with a bruising dismissal of Russian 30th seed Karen Khachanov on Friday. Nadal's 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) win against Khachanov on Centre Court equalled the Spaniard's personal record of 28 successive sets won at Grand Slams, a blistering streak dating back to this year's Australian Open final. World number two Nadal is in formidable form heading into only his second fourth round appearance in his last five visits to Wimbledon. He will face 16th seed Gilles Muller for a place in the quarter-finals. "I played fantastic for a set and a half but it got tougher after that. He started to hit stronger so I was happy to get through in three sets," said Nadal, the champion in 2008 and 2010. He will take a 5-1 lead over Muller into their fourth round match, but Nadal will be wary of a man who beat him at Wimbledon 12 years ago. "He's a very tough opponent, grass is his specialist surface," said the Spaniard. AFP
