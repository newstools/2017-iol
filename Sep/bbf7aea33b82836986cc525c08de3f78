Staff at leading hotels in Durban left their jobs for a day to explore township culture in Inanda in commemoration of World Tourism Day on September 27. Organised by WOWZULU together with the help of Discover Durban and Inanda Community Tourism, the event kept in line with this year's theme of sustainable tourism. The tour allowed people to feel the warmth of the locals, hear their stories, taste their cuisine and enjoy some of the most scenic views Durban has to offer. It was the first visit to a township for some of the hotel staff, who came from Happy Hippo, Elangeni and Oyster Box Hotel. Around 30 establishments were invited for the event, sadly only a handful attended. 
"It was my first experience and it is definitely not my last. I can't wait to tell my friends about these hidden gems," says guest relations officer of Oyster Box, Samantha Pegden. One of her most memorable experience was the beadwork demonstration at one of the huts in the Mzinyathi rural area, outside Inanda. She now has a small bracelet with red, pink and orange beading that she will keep as a remembrance of the trip.  Also on the tour was Malusi Sabelo, the bar manager at Happy Hippo hostels in South Beach. Sabelo, a township boy, having grown up in Adams in Illovo, says he has new found appreciation for the township culture after attending the educational. 
“A lot of tourists, including those from Germany and United Kingdom always asks me what they should do when they are in Durban. For me, this experience in Inanda is a unique offering that everyone should enjoy when visiting the city,” he said. Elsewhere, Tourism KwaZulu-Natal marked the occasion with their #WeDoTourism campaign.
