Volkswagen has been teasing the world with the possibility of a reincarnated Kombi with retro styling ever since the Microbus Concept of 2001 but so far nothing has ever materialised. But the possibility is looking better than ever according to reports out of Europe. Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess recently told Auto Express that the company is working on a new MPV-type vehicle with retro styling cues from the T1 and T2 buses of the ‘50s and ‘60s, and that it’ll form part of the upcoming ‘ID’ family of electric vehicles – something that’ll surely keep the hippies happy. They’ll also likely appreciate the vehicle’s seating configuration, assuming it follows that of the ID Buzz Concept that was revealed at the Detroit show earlier this year, and which serves as our biggest bag of clues to date about the forthcoming bus. The Buzz has three seating rows that can be configured into an overnight arrangement with a double bed at the back and two lie-flat middle chairs complete with a selection of individual scatter cushions. While initial versions of the 21st century Kombi won’t be fully autonomous like the concept, it will feature an electric drivetrain, possibly with a driving range, between recharges, of up to 600km as per the concept. The vehicle features an electric motor on each axle, making it all-wheel-drive, and they’re fed by a pack of 12 batteries mounted on the floor within the wheelbase. This layout also maximises interior space, which is what the Kombi was all about in the first place. The ID line-up will also include a Golf-sized hatchback that VW believes will make history by sparking an affordable battery car revolution. Read more about it here.
