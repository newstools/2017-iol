Makes 12 Preparation time: 20 minutes, plus 
chilling Cooking time: 5 minutes  350g Oreo biscuits 125g unsalted butter, melted 2 tsp powdered gelatine 4 tbsp hot water 175g white chocolate, roughly chopped 350g  cream cheese 300ml (Â½ pint) double cream 1 tsp vanilla bean paste 100g golden caster sugar  Line the base of a 23cm square springform cake tin with baking paper. Using a knife, open up 250g of Oreo biscuits. Scrape the creamy filling into a large bowl and set aside. Put the biscuits into a food processor and whizz until they resemble fine breadcrumbs.  Add the melted butter and mix until well combined. Using a tablespoon, press the biscuit base evenly into the prepared tin and leave to firm up in the refrigerator. Meanwhile, put the gelatine into a small heatproof bowl, pour over the four tablespoons of water and set aside. Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, making sure the surface of the water does not touch the bowl. Leave to cool for a few minutes. Scrape the creamy filling from the remaining biscuits and add to the bowl with the other biscuit filling, then crush the remaining biscuits and set aside. Beat the cream cheese, cream, vanilla paste, Oreo filling and sugar together in a bowl using an electric hand whisk. Stir in the gelatine mixture and the melted white chocolate, then fold in the crushed biscuits, reserving a few crumbs for decoration. Pour the mixture on to the biscuit base, keeping a little bit back to use as decoration. Leave to set in the refrigerator for about four hours. Using a sharp knife dipped in hot water, cut into 12 small squares. Add a small scoop of the remaining cream mixture to the top of each square, then dust with the reserved cookie crumbs for decoration.
