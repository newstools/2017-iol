Vredenburg - An armed robbery suspect's luck ran out after Vredenburg police found him hiding in a fridge on Tuesday morning. The suspect, 29, was nabbed following a tracing operation by members of Vredenburg Detective Services in Louwville, police said in a statement. "Whilst conducting a tracing operation in Louwville [officers] again tried to trace a ‘wanted’ criminal at a premises in Oxford Road in Louwville. "At about 6:30am, the members approached the house and were again informed by an occupant of the house that the person they are looking for are not staying at that address."
 Police, who had a warrant of arrest in their possession, decided to carry out a search in the house which then led to them discovering the suspect in the fridge, hiding. The man, wanted in connection with another armed robbery case in February 2016, was then arrested and has since appeared in the Vredenburg Magistrates' court. IOL
