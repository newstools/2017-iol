oil price dropped to $46.71 a barrel early in the month, but recovered quickly
to $50.59 a barrel. The increases in the average international prices of
petroleum products caused increases of 1.0 cents per liter in the price of petrol and 14.5 cents per liter in the price of diesel. “The volatility in the daily
average exchange rate during the past month between R/$13.54 and R/$12.86 added
further expected increases of 11.9 cents per liter to the gasoline price and
12.1 cent per liter to the diesel price,” said Brink. The final price changes
would be announced by the Minister of Energy on Friday. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
