This year represents Capricorn FM’s 10th birthday and they’re hoping to mark the occasion with a stellar, action-packed year. First up is the 2017 Capricorn FM Lifestyle and Music Festival this Saturday, an event which is set to be the biggest lifestyle and entertainment event on Limpopo’s calendar. The festival is a rebranded version of the Limpopo Music Festival, which hasn’t been done in a long time. When Tholi B joined Capricorn FM as its station manager last year, he made it his objective to bring it back with a new lifestyle message. What they’ve done differently this time around is set up pop up art stalls to create a platform to showcase Limpopo arts and crafts and the young creative entrepreneurs driving it. To embrace the region’s diversity, Tholi B and his team made a point of avoiding making it a house or hip hop event by putting together a line-up that represents an amalgamation of genres. Hip hop superstar, AKA who is one of the headline performers said that Polokwane is a place where he feels at home and he’s looking forward to the festival. He also spoke briefly about how he came to be involved in the festival: “Capricorn FM is a station that really supports and plays my music. Every time I’m in the area I always make sure that I go there and show love back.” The festival will also see performances from the likes of Kwesta, Black Motion, DJ Zinhle and Mafikizolo alongside some up and coming local acts. After this festival the station will be preparing for June’s Castle Lite Unlocks event with Bryson Tiller and Travis Scott in Polokwane where they are media partners. They’re also working on a number of other projects this year, said Tholi B. “This year we’ve got the Entrepreneurs Seminar in June, then we’re focusing on tourism. We’ve got different themes every year and we’re focusing on tourism because this is the most toured province in the country.”
