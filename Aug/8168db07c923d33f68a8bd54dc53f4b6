Johannesburg - DA leader Mmusi Maimane has laid charges against the Gupta family and the Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane for the alleged theft of public funds linked to a Free State farming community project. 
 
Maimane handed a legal indictment to the Hawks on Thursday for the matter to be investigated. 
 The DA leader alleges that, in 2013, when Zwane was the MEC for Agriculture in the province, he launched a Dairy Farm Project meant to uplift the community. 
 
But those funds never made it back to community and the project never took off as the funds, about R200 million, landed in the hands of the Gupta family and their associates, Maimane said.
 
It then emerged that the money had possibly been used to finance the Gupta family's infamous wedding in 2013. "The indictment consists of the necessary evidence – including relevant leaked "Gupta emails"  - involving the Guptas, Cabinet Ministers, and others implicated in this scandal. This indictment provides all the evidence needed for the authorities to forge ahead with prosecution," said Maimane.   We're unrelenting in our effort to seek justice for those South Africans who are the victims of the ANC’s State Capture project. #VredeDairy pic.twitter.com/KwwKvHDgVF  — Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) August 24, 2017   Politics Hub
