Johannesburg - The Gauteng Education Department said on Tuesday, that teaching and learning had resumed as per normal in all schools in the south, east, and west of Johannesburg. In a statement, the department confirmed that there was no go-slow in these areas, as schooling proceeded without disruption. "We are delighted that the educators did not accede to a call to participate in a so-called ‘go-slow’ during school hours, as this has a negative impact for the future of our learners." This follows a tip-off that coloured educators from around nine schools in coloured communities would embark in a go-slow in solidarity with Klipspruit Wes Secondary School in Soweto. "We urge community members to use available structures to raise issues of concern and not resort to any form of disruption at our schools," the department said. "MEC Panyaza Lesufi would like to appeal to members of Klipspruit-Wes to afford him an opportunity to finalise the appointment of the principal at Klipspruit-Wes and report the way forward in due course." The department said that they respected and upheld everyone’s right to protest as enshrined in our constitution, however they requested communities who engaged in protests not to disrupt learning and teaching in schools. "We will continue to monitor the situation in the affected areas." African News Agency
