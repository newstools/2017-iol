 Disgraced Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane has been replaced as acting National Police Commissioner, it was announced on Thursday. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula announced during a media briefing that Phahlane has been "relieved of his duties". "President Jacob Zuma, in exercising his prerogative, has relieved Lt-General Phahlane from his position of acting national police commissioner. We wish to thank the president for his wisdom and decisive action in this regard," Mbalula told a media briefing in Cape Town. "There are clearly serious allegations of misconduct on the part of Lt-General Phahlane which also impact on his fitness to hold office to hold office as the acting national police commissioner. The allegations against Lt-General Phahlane raise questions of conduct." Phahlane's acting tenure effectively ended on June 1. The Presidency, in a statement, announced that Lieutenant-General Lesetja Mothiba had been appointed as the new acting national commissioner, with immediate effect. Mothiba previously headed the SAPS divisional head of the management intervention unit. Zuma thanked Phahlane for his leadership in the position and congratulated the new commissioner on his new post. African News Agency
