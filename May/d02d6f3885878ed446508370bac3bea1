Local celebrities love holidays in different African countries. We spoke to some to find out which African destination they love to visit.  Mayuri Naidoo, High Rollers actress Favourite African destination: I love my home country South Africa. The people are so diverse and despite our history and political differences we rub along together quite well. I'm proud of how much we have progressed as a people, and that when something is done and it's wrong, we unite for the cause. I choose to see the good because there is a lot of good. Why should we visit: We have so much natural beauty and wonderful things to see and explore. Go and visit the wine farms in Cape Town, Enjoy the beauty of Durban, Drakensberg, Clarens and remember to go on a to a game reserve. Chris Jaftha, Top Billing   Favourite African destination: Zanzibar is considered to be its own country seeing that it has its own government separate from Tanzania. That being said, Zanzibar is my favorite. Why should we visit: Take a night swims in the calm sea, that averages 26 degrees day and night, the bioluminescent plankton lights up when you swim in the water and its most visible in the evening. It is absolutely magical.  Ryan Keys , Designer Favourite African destination: I am in love with Mauritius. I fall in love with it more and more every time I go. The weather is always great, the beaches are pristine and the cocktails are always flowing. I am more of a relaxed beach type of guy and like to do nothing but relax on the beach with a good book.  Why should we visit:  No one leaves Mauritius without shopping at Port Louis. Also try a catamaran trip to any of the islands where you will have lobster on the beach with local rums and lots of snorkeling . I do the catamaran trips every time and they never are boring.
