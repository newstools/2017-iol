The three-day sporting showcase took place at Sandringham Farm at the weekend and included a number of activities for the whole family. Big favourites were the drone racing, watersports, BMX biking and The Grind obstacle course. Hassiem participated in the Extreme Speaker Box where he delivered a 
motivational talk about how he coped after losing his right leg  to a great white shark at Muizenberg beach. “The event itself is amazing and it is such a great venue, so many activities going on from drone racing to people having a pool where you can literally dive in and people bouncing on trampolines. It is absolutely phenomenal. “For a guy who is a athlete, the vibe you want to be in, everything is active and people can just come and enjoy themselves, which is great.” Azrah Bassier from Cape Town said: “I only knew about it because my uncle is working here. “Also it’s expensive to get in and then you still have to pay for stuff as well, so a lot of people aren’t going on the rides.” Devin De Moylane said: “I’m glad I came because there is a lot more than I expected. “I came to see the drone racing because that was what I saw on social media and while that was awesome to watch, the BMX guys were crazy and the skydiving was pretty cool.” Cape Argus
