Cape Town - A tweet by Mzwanele Manye, the president of Progressive Professionals Forum, who is also a staunch supporter of the ANC, and President Zuma in particular takes aim at former MP Vytjie Mentor, showing her purportedly having a discussion with billionaire Johann Rupert on what appears to be a private aircraft.Last year Mentor publicly recounted how she was invited to the Gupta family's Saxonwold mansion and offered a ministerial position by the brothers, who are close friends of the Zuma family, while the president was in the next room.Look what I stumbled upon pic.twitter.com/KihJ5FvWdtLook what I stumbled upon pic.twitter.com/KihJ5FvWdt Mzwanele Manyi (@MzwaneleManyi) March 6, 2017</blockquote> Black Twitter of course did not miss the opportunity to shoot down Mr Manye.
