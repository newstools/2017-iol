Cape Town - Hanover Park was on lockdown Saturday evening following deadly shootouts in the area that resulted in two murders, one attempted murder and the wounding of three police officers who responded to the scene. According to police, the members were responding to shooting incidents in the area when they themselves were attacked. Residents in the area took to social media to express their outrage at the recent spike in shootings which was fuelled by the fatal shooting of a known gangster in the area. Residents also stated that ambulances were unable to go into the area as it had been put on lockdown. Spokesperson for Emergency Medical Services Robert Daniels said they received reports of violence in the area shortly after 6pm from members and took a decision to not enter the area as police were not entering it either. The police are not going in and if they are not, either can we, we cannot risk the safety of our members but as soon as police go in the area and our members get an escort then so can we,” he said. However police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut denied talk that members were unable to enter the area. He said officers had been there since responding to two murders and one attempted murder that occurred earlier in the afternoon. “[Saturday] afternoon at around 5.30pm police members reacted to shooting incidents which occurred in the Hanover Park area when they came under fire. Three SAPS members were wounded and admitted to hospital where they are being treated,” he said.   “Additional forces have been deployed to the area and a stern approach is being applied to quell the violence in the area.” Last month two police officers were left wounded following an attack by a group of angry residents while attending a murder scene of an 18-year-old who had been shot. A video that circulated on social media showed how residents stoned police vehicles after officers arrested a suspect who had been wanted on a different murder case.
