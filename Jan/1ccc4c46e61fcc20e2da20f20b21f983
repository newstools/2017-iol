Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed that cases of murder and attempted murder are under investigation. She said according to information received, the incident occurred on Wednesday just before 9am. “A 29-year-old woman was shot and fatally wounded and a six-month-old baby was shot and wounded. “The child was transported to hospital for medical treatment,” said Rwexana. She said suspects are yet to be arrested, and the circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation. Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Robert Daniels said at 9am yesterday the mother of a baby girl was shot dead and the child critically wounded. Nyanga’s Community Police Forum’s Martin Makhasi said that according to some residents, the shooting happened after three men forced their way into the house, demanding money. “We are more than devastated by the news, and are bothered by the lack of safety of people in their own homes. "We urge the residents to assist the police with any information regarding the incident.” A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she woke up after hearing screams. Police appealed to anyone with information to contact the investigating officer on 078 297 4573 or Nyanga SAPS on 021 380 3379. The incident comes hours after another child was shot in Hanover Park on Tuesday night. Rwexana said the incident happened shortly after 8pm and that the gunman had not yet been identified. The child was taken to hospital for medical treatment. An attempted murder case was opened. Last Wednesday Alizwa Makhandi, 7, was killed when she was hit in the head by a stray bullet while playing outside her aunt’s home in DT Block informal settlement. Cape Argus
