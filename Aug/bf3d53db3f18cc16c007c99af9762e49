Rita Ora spent Wednesday helping a relief centre in Dallas, Texas to aid the victims of Houston's Hurricane Harvey. The 'Your Song' hitmaker took to Twitter on Wednesday to ask her 6.4 million followers if they knew of any places she could visit in the city to offer her services before she headed back home. She wrote: "I'm trying to find a Houston Texas shelter in Dallas to go and help before I leave Texas! I want to help (sic)". The 26-year-old singer, who volunteered to do similar work after the Grenfell Tower flats fire in London in June, was successful as she was later spotted putting items such as nappies and food into boxes at a donation centre set up by KISS FM radio station, which will be sent to the relief zones 200 miles outside of Houston. The British pop star joins a number of celebrities who have helped out the victims of the natural disaster including Leonardo DiCaprio, who donated $1 million to the United Way Harvey Recovery Fund - a national fund which will donate 100 per cent of its pledges directly to those affected by the natural disaster in Texas - via his self-titled foundation. Brian Gallagher, president of United Way Worldwide - which was only announced yesterday (30.08.17) - said: "We are incredibly grateful for the generosity of Leonardo DiCaprio and his foundation. "Responding to Hurricane Harvey requires the best of all of us - and that's what this gift represents. "United Way's Harvey Recovery Fund will provide much-needed help for the communities along the Gulf Coast where lives have been changed forever." Miley Cyrus too donated $500 000 (R6.5 million) , Beyonce, Sandra Bullock and Solange have also done their bit to support the fund. Jamie Foxx will co-host a telethon to raise money and the 49-year-old actor has already donated $25,000 (approximately R300 000). The tropical storm has wreaked havoc in Texas, killing at least 31 people and destroying more than 50 000 homes.
