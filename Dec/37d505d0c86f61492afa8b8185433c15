CAPE TOWN - Household electricity usage may increase during the festive as most of the family members are at home for the entire day, as people are on holiday.  A rise in household electricity usage would impact on your budget. In ensuring that the festive season budget is not overridden by electricity bills, homeowners need to take the responsibility to use alternative technologies to save electricity. Head of Marketing and Sales at Energy Partners Home Solutions, Cala van der Westhuizen, notes that property owners can reduce their electricity costs by as much as 80% with the right combination of energy saving technologies. Van der Westhuizen maintains that homeowners can use their own discretion as to how much they want to save and invest in energy efficiency. "Replacing light bulbs with energy efficient lighting, and replacing home’s geyser with a heat pump and installing a highly insulated hot water storage system, cuts the home’s electricity costs by an estimated 50%," Van der Westhuizen added.
