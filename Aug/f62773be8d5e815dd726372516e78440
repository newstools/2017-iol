Johannesburg - A 35-year-old mother was arrested for allegedly killing her seven-day-old baby at Zebediela hospital, Limpopo police said on Thursday. She was arrested by police in Magatle, outside Lebowakgomo. "The suspect gave birth to this baby in the hospital ... the baby was still under care in the children's unit. She allegedly entered that room as if she wanted to breastfeed the child," said police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. "She subsequently grabbed the baby from the incubator and started hitting the nurse with the baby, she further struck the baby's head against the floor." The baby died instantly. The mother is expected to appear before the Magatle Magistrate's Court on Thursday to face a charge of murder. African News Agency
