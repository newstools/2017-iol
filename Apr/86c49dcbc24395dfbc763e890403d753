Young gun Anthony Joshua got up off the canvas to stop former champion Wladimir Klitschko Saturday in the 11th round of a heavyweight world title fight that is being hailed as an epic. In a tumultuous atmosphere at Wembley Stadium, 90,000 fans saw the undefeated 27-year-old add the World Boxing Association (WBA) title to his International Boxing Federation (IBF) belt sparked by a devastating right uppercut that led to the 41-year-old Klitschko being felled in the 11th. The Ukrainian former world champion rose unsteadily before being floored again.    He bravely got up once more but referee David Fields waved it off soon after as he was unable to defend himself against a barrage of Joshua blows on the ropes.   American Boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard was among those who immediately hailed the contest as 'amazing'. "Such an amazing fight with 2 great fighters. Lot of heart by both fighters. A lot of questions answered by @anthonyfjoshua #JoshuaKlitchsko," he tweeted. AFP
