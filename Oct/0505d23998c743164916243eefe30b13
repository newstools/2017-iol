Johannesburg - The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) confirmed on Thursday that the principal and the entire senior management of a Soweto school had been removed from the school with immediate effect, following sexual assault allegations of 83 learners by a scholar patroller. "We remain grateful to all stakeholders especially the Teddy Bear Clinic and our Psycho Social Support Services. I am grateful that the department has prioritised this matter and we will leave no stone unturned,” said MEC Panyaza Lesufi in a statement.
