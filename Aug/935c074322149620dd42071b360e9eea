Manchester United winger Anthony Martial has made an impressive start to the season, but manager Jose Mourinho believes the France international must deliver consistently to fulfil his potential at the club. Martial is pushing for a spot in the starting line-up for Saturday’s Premier League game against Leicester City following two goals from the bench in United’s consecutive victories over West Ham United and Swansea City. “I think when you are blessed with some talent, you have to fulfil that talent, you have to explore that talent, you cannot be happy just with glimpses of talent and that I am not going to change,” Mourinho told in a news conference. “I want more and more and more from him because he has all the qualities. “I think he understands me better too, and the personal relation is good. Anthony, I hope, is going to be better this season than last season.” Mourinho hailed the impact of attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who has kicked off the campaign in style, claiming four assists in the opening two games. “I think he understands me and to be honest, I understand him. Because in the beginning of the (last) season, if he understands me better, he would have started better,” Mourinho added. “But we spent time, working together. I know him well, he knows me well, and the second part of the season was good for him, and I think this season is going to be even better.” Zlatan Ibrahimovic, United’s top scorer last season, rejoined the club on Thursday, but Mourinho does not expect the Swede to recover from his knee ligament injury until the second half of the season. “He won’t be ready for the group phase of the Champions League,” said Mourinho. “No chance of that. Hopefully he can play in the knockout stage, but for that, we have to finish in (the) top two. I just think he will be (an) extra man for us in the second part of the season.” Reuters
