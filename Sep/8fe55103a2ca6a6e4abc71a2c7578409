CAPE TOWN -The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse is pleased with the recent PRCA expulsion of fraudulent and Gupta-linked public relations company, Bell Pottinger. OUTA claims that civil society and political action have the ability to overcome illicit dealings and halt world renowned public relations firms like Bell Pottinger. “We are pleased that the UK’s Public Relations Communication Association (PRCA) has taken steps to expel Bell Pottinger from its ranks, as a result of the complaint raised by the DA. This is a clear indication that the South African society at large was right to express outrage and disgust at the conduct of both the Gupta family and Bell Pottinger, about their carefully and purposefully planned social media strategy to inflame racial discord in South Africa", said OUTA’s Chairperson, Wayne Duvenage.

This presents the unjust advantage which management enjoy. OUTA condemns the fraud committed by the PR company which benefitted the portrayal of the Gupta family from state capture. Bell Pottinger executed fraud of fake news and forged social media accounts, all in the hope of depicting the notorious Gupta-family in a favourable light, thus, for personal gain. "We trust that the loss of many lucrative customers, its tarnished reputation, the resignation of its key staff and its expulsion from the industry body will be the ultimate lesson for the Bell Pottinger board. What makes this outcome more rewarding is that this woeful outcome for Bell Pottinger has been wrought without the need for society to introduce expensive litigation action, in order for the transgressor to suffer the consequences of its unwarranted conduct", says Duvenage.   - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
