Mitsubishi has treated its ASX to another makeover, the compact crossover gaining a restyled front end, comfier seats and an additional model in the form of an entry-level CVT derivative. The updated ASX range now costs between R364 900 and R434 900 (up by R10 000 at the bottom of the range and R20 000 at the top), and we suspect it might be quite a hard sell at this level, considering how closely it’s priced to the mainstream C-segment crossovers (see rival comparison below story). Thing is, the ASX is both smaller and more dated than its rivals, having first appeared abroad as far back as 2010. <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> So what’s new then? The stylistic changes all take place upfront, where the ASX falls into line with Mitsubishi’s ‘Dynamic Shield’ design theme, with claw-shaped chrome accents jutting outwards from the large front grille, which now connects to the headlights as well. The rest of the exterior design remains as before and same goes for the cabin, except that the seat cushions have been redesigned with a focus on long-distance comfort. Mitsubishi has added a continuously variable transmission (CVT) option to its entry-level GL model, but other than that the range continues as before, with all models powered by a 110kW/197Nm 2-litre normally aspirated petrol engine, driving the front wheels. Even the entry-level GL is fairly well equipped with standard features including an aircon, audio system with Bluetooth and voice control, multi-function steering wheel, rear park distance control, auto lights and windscreen wipers, seven airbags and ABS. The entry model doesn’t have traction control however. For that you have to opt for the mid-range GLX, which also adds a colour touch-screen infotainment system with reverse camera, heated leather seats (with electric adjustment for the driver) and a full-length panoramic glass roof. The range-topping GLX adds a fancy Rockford Fosgate audio system to the mix. All of them are sold with a three-year / 100 000km warranty and five-year / 90 000km service plan. Mitsubishi confidently states that its new 2.0 GL CVT is “easily the best sub R400 000 vehicle on the market.” But looking at the other options listed below, we will have to agree to disagree.
