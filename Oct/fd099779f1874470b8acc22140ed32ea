PETA have slammed Kris Jenner for wearing fur in a new picture. The 61-year-old showbiz matriarch posed for a new photograph wearing a fur wrap, with a snakeskin bag and leather boots and PETA (People For The Ethical Treatment Of Animals) took to Twitter to hit out at her. Sharing the picture, PETA added images of a white fox, snake and a calf and wrote: "You're doing amazing being evil, sweetie. CC: Kris Jenner."  Meanwhile, Pamela Anderson recently revealed that Kris' daughter Kim Kardashian West has ignored her letter begging her to stop wearing fur. The former 'Baywatch' actress - who is a long-time vegan and animal rights activists - penned the 37-year-old reality TV star a note recently urging her to omit animal skin, including leather, fur, feathers and suede, from her wardrobe and to show more compassion to the innocent creatures being slaughtered purely for fashion. However, her pleas have so far gone unanswered. The 50-year-old star said: "Girl to girl, I think Kim has a great heart and I know she's a great influencer ... I wrote Kim Kardashian a letter and I spoke to her at fashion week. No response yet. I talk to Melania [Trump], many people that are in the public eye, to dress more compassionately because you're a role model." And in 2012, Kris' daughter Khloe cut ties with PETA after learning that the animal-rights activist who flour-bombed Kim had links to the group. She said: "Not only has PETA lied to the public, but they have proved that they support this kind of behaviour. I've been a vocal supporter of PETA for a long time but I have also been very vocal about anti-bullying, so this was a huge disappointment for me."
