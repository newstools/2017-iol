Elegance is synonymous with David Tlale. As he unveiled his new collection at a photoshoot in his boutique in the Maboneng crescent, opulence, class and sophistication were the order of the day. Known for his eccentric and unpredictable designs, the award-winning couturier showcased his versatility. Tlale informed the gathering that the fashions were simple, yet classy, and affordable. The new collection will also cater to the fuller figured women. Tlale used just one model to show off his new outfits, and as she changed into a different garment, he cut a dash posing on his signature gold throne.
This mainstream range allows every woman to savour the sophistication that offers David Tlale garments. These very garments are inspired by a “modular” approach in design through architecture. For this new line the Creative Director designed a collection for a modern woman.Influenced by the vision of a woman who can do it all, the collection suits any occasion. The David by David Tlale woman is always elegant and stylish in a professional environment, a night out or on a Sunday afternoon. “Through this new range I wanted to speak to a wider population. The price point for this collection is affordable, the style is still very David Tlale and appealing to a trendy clientele. In terms of sizes the range embrace all body types, shapes and sizes” says Tlale. Having made his name with haute couture, Tlale’s ready-to-wear line is a bit of a departure from his flamboyant style. It was a creative challenge however, that he seemed to enjoy. Pleased by the success of the previous collection, the brand decided to renew its partnership with Spree the South-African well-known online retailer. Both big names of the clothing industry aim to provide customers style, affordable products without compromising on quality. With the same enthusiasm and dedication as the premium range, David by David Tlale is proudly made in South Africa. Pictures: Supplied by David Tlale IOL
