Reality TV star Kim Kardashian West has confessed she used to be an expert voicemail hacker and used her skills to get some "major dirt back in the day". The 37-year-old reality TV star has confessed she used to be able to access the recorded messages left on her ex-boyfriends' phones without them knowing and her friends would also get her to listen to messages left on their partners handsets. However, Kim doesn't spy on anyone anymore now she's happily married to Kanye West. Speaking on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' with guest host Jennifer Lawrence, she said: "I retired before I get into trouble. I used to be the go to 'spy' that everyone would call and try to get info on their boyfriends or husbands. I was just probably in a really insecure and in an un-trusting relationship, it's not like that anymore. I don't hack. "There is this service that I figured out, that you can call someone's number and can make it look like somebody else's number that's calling them. So what I figured out is how to get into the voicemail system is to call them but make it look like it's your own number calling it tricks the system and gets right into the voicemail system. "We're screwed now there's texting because no one leaves voicemail anymore but I got some dirt back in the day. I got major dirt back in the day." The reality TV star - who has two children with Kanye, daughter North, four, and 23-month-old son Saint - was once left embarrassed and upset by her hacking skills when she used her sleuthing skills on an ex-boyfriend only to discover he had ditched her on her birthday to meet another girl. She said: "I got into the voicemail thing. I was at dinner with all of my friends and put it on speaking phone wondering where his boyfriend was. He was flying into town to meet another girl on my birthday. He lied about being in a different state." A stunner Jennifer replied, "Oh my god, that's like a Taylor Swift song," seemingly forgetting her close pal Kim's feud with the pop star.
