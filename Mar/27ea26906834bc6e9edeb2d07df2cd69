The women, one of whom is Debby Jessop-Hogg, were walking their two spaniels on the beach near the old navy barracks on Friday morning, when two pitbulls ran out and attacked the women and their dogs. June Hessop, Debby’s sister, said last night the two were in hospital. “Everyone is still very stressed and tired and hot from the worry about my sister and from the search for the dog,” she said. One dog, Abbi Gail, was bit on the lip by the pitbulls, while Milli Mo ran away. “Everyone is still out searching for Milli Mo and we hope to find her soon we would like people to keep an eye out for her,” said Hessop. Paramedics Rescue Care spokeswoman Ceron Lennox said both woman had sustained bites to their lower limbs and were stabilised on the scene before being transported to hospital. “The one injured dog was taken to a vet nearby for treatment. A second dog is still missing as it ran away from the attack. The two pitbulls ran away,” said Lennox. There was a call on social media on Friday night for any information on the dogs or the pitbulls. Milli Mo was believed to be wearing a purple lead attached to her collar. Please call Hessop on 082563 3190 if she is seen or found. Independent on Saturday
