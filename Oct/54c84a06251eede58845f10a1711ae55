"The 'film' was made with blatant disregard of both the Steenkamp and Pistorius families, as well as complete disregard for Reeva and Oscar. Neither Oscar, the defence, or the family were involved in the production of this 'film' in any way," the statement read. "The 'film' is not (a) true reflection of what happened on the day of this tragedy and the subsequent trial of the matter. "The 'film' titled 'Oscar Pistoruis: The Blade Runner Killer' is a gross distorition of the findings of the court," Pistorius said.
