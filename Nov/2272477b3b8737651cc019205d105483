EDINBURGH – Codie Taylor is the only change to world champions New Zealand’s starting XV to play Scotland on Saturday from the one that eased past France last weekend. The 26-year-old hooker – who will win his 27th cap – comes in for the injured Dane Coles, who went off in the 24th minute of the 38-18 triumph in Paris. Nathan Harris takes Taylor’s spot on the bench, while Liam Squire also joins the replacements. All Black head coach Steve Hansen said he was expecting a no-holds-barred encounter against an attack-minded Scotland, who last Saturday won a thrilling Test with Samoa 44-38. The Scots have never beaten New Zealand in 30 previous encounters, and two draws are the best they have mustered. An All Black B team beat a French XV again, 28-23, on Tuesday in Lyon. Hansen said their performance should motivate the regular starters. “This Test against Scotland will be an opportunity for this group of players to take on the challenge of raising the bar on the performance which was set down by their teammates on Tuesday,” said Hansen. “Scotland will be a formidable opponent who, from all indications, will be looking to play skilful rugby and an up-tempo game. “Therefore, we’ll need to meet this challenge head-on and be prepared to empty the tank and exert our own pressure upon them through both our physicality, our own tempo in the game and executing our skills at the highest level.” All Black Team 15 Damian McKenzie, 14 Waisake Naholo, 13 Ryan Crotty, 12 Sonny Bill Williams, 11 Rieko Ioane, 10 Beauden Barrett, 9 Aaron Smith, 8 Kieran Read (captain), 7 Sam Cane, 6 Vaea Fifita, 5 Sam Whitelock, 4 Luke Romano, 3 Nepo Laulala, 2 Codie Taylor, 1 Kane Hames. Bench: 16 Nathan Harris, 17 Wyatt Crockett, 18 Ofa Tu’ungafasi, 19 Liam Squire, 20 Matt Todd, 21 TJ Perenara, 22 Lima Sopoaga, 23 Anton Lienert-Brown. AFP
