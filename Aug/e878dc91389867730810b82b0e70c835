Taylor Swift is in a "one-way feud" with Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West as they have both moved on. Taylor and Kanye have been feuding ever since the 40-year-old rapper stormed the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2009 because he thought Beyonc√© deserved the Best Female Video prize over her. Kanye also took aim at Taylor on his track 'Famous' last year, in which he referred to the singer as a "bitch*" and joked about sleeping with her and although Taylor, 27, claimed she was taken by surprise by its release, Kanye's wife Kim released videos of her husband discussing the project on the phone with Taylor. However, the Wests appear to want to put the feud behind them and even though Taylor has taken aim at them both in her new song 'Look What You Made Me Do' and its accompanying video, sources close to Kim and Kanye insist they have moved on. TMZ reports that Kanye is more concerned about his ongoing feud with his former collaborator Jay Z and that Taylor "isn't even on his radar". And as far as Kim, 36, is concerned, "the whole feud ended over a year ago". However, this has not stopped Taylor from continuing the war, as she takes aim at Kanye in the lyrics for her new track. Taylor slams someone for their "titled stage", which the 'All Day' hitmaker had one during his 'Saint Pablo' tour in 2016. Declaring her hate towards the person, the 'Shake It Off' hitmaker sings the line: "I don't like your little games/ Don't like your titled stage/ The role you made me play/ Of the fool/ No, I don't like you." And in the video, she also appeared to take aim at Kim's terrifying ordeal last year, when a number of armed robbers burst into the star's Paris hotel room, tied her up and put her in the bathtub while they absconded with millions worth of jewels. As the lyrics "The role you made me play / Of the fool, no, I don't like you / I don't like your perfect crime" play, Taylor can be seen lying in a bath of jewels.
