The Cape Wine Auction has raised a staggering R31 million in three years and created a unique funding model, a first for South Africa, to ensure that the money is invested for maximum impact. Cape Wine Auction Trust facilitator Andi Norton says that the collaborative approach and first of its kind donor funding model contributed greatly to the outstanding results.  “We know that donor fatigue sets in when funders do not perceive a real return on social investment, so we decided to create a model whereby all our beneficiaries are collaborating, sharing expertise and working together and not in isolation as one often finds with some charitable organisations.
