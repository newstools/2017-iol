Johannesburg - Jacaranda FM has posted a disturbing hit and (attempted) run crash video to its YouTube channel, depicting a Johannesburg driver trying to flee the scene of a serious accident and a group of good samaritans foiling his plans. The shaky footage filmed from a dashcam (or cellphone) shows a driver veering between lanes on the N1 highway near Centurion, before the car ploughs into the back of a bakkie, sending it into the median barrier and rolling onto its roof.   The crash instigator then tries to make a run for it, but is blocked in the fast lane by three fellow road users who witnessed the crime. At this stage the culprit’s motives are unknown, as is the condition of the flipped bakkie’s poor occupants. IOL Motoring
