JOHANNESBURG – Polokwane City and Baroka FC were forced to settle for a 0-0 draw in their opening Premiership match at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. Finding a goal in the early-season encounter proved elusive, and both managers would have been left frustrated following a contest where there were chances, albeit few, to grab three points for either outfit. Coming into the game, Baroka would have been aiming to make good start after finishing second from bottom last season. In a sedate opening period, Polokwane held the upper hand in the possession stakes but did little with the ball up front. The first real chance of the encounter fell to Polokwane at the feet of Rodney Ramagalela, but he blasted his shot wide from the edge of the box. Baroka accrued a decent opportunity as Gift Motupa held up the ball well in the middle of the park, before picking out Talent Chawapiwa, but the Zimbabwean could not find the mark from close range. A golden opportunity for Baroka was spurned four minutes before the break, as Mduduzi Mdatsane’s effort flew narrowly over the crossbar. Moments before halftime, Polokwane were closest to taking the lead as Jabu Maluleke was on the end of a Ramagalela cross, but again the shot was off-target. When play resumed in the second half, both teams fashioned chances but the attempts continued to remain wide of the mark. Edgar Manaka had a glorious chance in the 70th minute for Polokwane, but his low pile-driver scorched inches wide. Try as they might both teams could not fashion a goal in the dying stages of the match, and a barren draw would be a fair reflection of the contest. African News Agency (ANA)
