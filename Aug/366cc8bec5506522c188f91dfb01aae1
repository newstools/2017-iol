Aretha Franklin wants to move to Detroit and open a nightclub. The 75-year-old soul icon - who recently announced she will be retiring this year - is planning to leave her home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, to move the short distance to Detroit, where she will open a nightspot and occasionally perform at the venue. The 'Respect' hitmaker said: "I'm interested in doing a small nightclub downtown, and he [estate agent Bruce Schwartz] and I have been talking about this for a couple of years now and I'm just letting him know I'm still interested. "In my retirement plan, I'd like to have a small club here in Detroit." Aretha has already come up with a name for the club and is planning to invite other artists to perform when she is not taking to the stage. Speaking to USA Today, she added: "It would be Aretha's! "From time to time I would sing, and of course, I would have special artists come in to perform for the city that people in Detroit like - Detroit favourites." Aretha will retire when her final album, a collaboration with Stevie Wonder, is released this September following a 57-year career.
