The DJ took to Twitter on Saturday afternoon to explain what happened. Using the hashtag #PIECESOFME, he tweeted: “1.A random guy demanded I opened the window at the Garage,smashed it with a hammer, pointed a gun demanded I gave him my watch” But it appears his robbers might be nabbed soon, as video footage captured the criminal act. Coffee said his attackers sped off in a white VW Polo Vivo. In a second tweet, he said, “2.White Polo Vivo.....Video footage and number plate will be posted soon....Thank God I’m ok,” followed by five “praying” emojis. Coffee and his fiance Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa got hitched in a star-studded celebrity wedding in Sun City on Sunday. The couple got engaged in 2010 and have two children together. Last year DJ Fresh, who was on the exclusive guest list, revealed the couple was already wed in a traditional ceremony in Soweto “several years back”. The couple are notoriously private about their personal life. Daily Voice
