Copenhagen â€“ A 17-year-old girl accused of plotting to carry out terrorist attacks on two schools is set to appear before a Danish court on Wednesday. The teen, a Danish convert to Islam, was arrested in January 2016 and prosecutors say she had had been waiting for the order to carry out the attacks. Investigators searching the girl's home in the Danish town of Kundby found instructions on how to build explosive devices, the Ritzau news agency reported. Prosecutors say she is so dangerous that she should be kept in custody for the foreseeable future. A verdict in the case is expected in May. dpa
