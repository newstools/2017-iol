Cape Town - Two ATM fraudsters were jointly sentenced to more than 100 years behind bars.The two kingpins of a Cape Town ATM fraud syndicate have been sentenced to record terms in jail, said the National Prosecuting Authority. Video footage at an ATM played a key role in their conviction.Michael Manyana, 51, and Millicent Mkhwanazi, 48, were sentenced by the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court in December to 53 and 50 years respectively for their roles as the syndicate s leaders.The gang preyed on pensioners, students and tourists for more than seven years between 2005 and 2012.NPA spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said video footage linked both to the crimes.Although Manyana s face was clearly visible in at least five video clips, he insisted it was not him.A lawyer for Mkhwanazi, who broke down in court and admitted guilt, indicated they would appeal the harsh sentence in the Cape Town High Court.The pair had been prosecuted under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA), which hands out severe sentences, of up to life imprisonment. It is still not clear how much money the two had amassed from their long list of victims.Manyana and Mkhwanazi were found guilty of racketeering, fraud, theft and contravening the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act.They were sentenced separately for the other charges, including stealing R1 000 from a pensioner in Parow, who asked them to assist him at an ATM in November 2011.In January 2012, they robbed an Angolan student of the R24 350 his parents had sent him after stealing his card in central Cape Town.In December 2011, they stole a woman s ATM card at a bank then withdrew R20 000.
