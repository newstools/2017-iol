Johannesburg A total of 1 523 people died in violent incidents, including bombings and shootings in Libya during 2016, the NGO Libyabodycount.org has reported.&nbsp; This figure was similar to the 1 519 people who died in similar circumstances during 2015 but much lower than the 2 825 people who lost their lives during bloody confrontations the year before.&nbsp; Three Libyan cities recorded deaths of more than 100 people with former dictator Muammar Gaddafi s home town of Sirte losing 693 residents, Benghazi in the east of Libya 307, and the capital Tripoli in the west 102.&nbsp; The violence was particularly high in Sirte, where Libyan soldiers have been battling to expel Islamic State (IS) extremists from the city situated on the Mediterranean coast, half-way between Tripoli and Benghazi.&nbsp; The IS state took over Sirte in 2014 before the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord s forces (Bunyan Marsous) launched their military campaign with the help of US air strikes.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Italy s new interior minister, Marco Minniti, is expected in Tripoli next week for talks on terrorism and curtailing migrant smuggling operations, the Libya Herald reported.&nbsp; He is due to meet Faiez Serraj, the head of Libya s Presidency Council, with the aim of working out an agreement on blocking illegal migration routes from Libya.&nbsp; Around 90 per cent of migrants arriving in Italy travel by boat from Libya, the Italian interior ministry reported in a statement.&nbsp; The number in 2016 was up to 176 554.&nbsp;That is eight times higher than in 2013.&nbsp; A UN report indicates that most of the migrants that arrived in Italy in 2016 were from Nigeria, Eritrea and Guinea.&nbsp; Rome s main objective is to prevent the migrants entering Libya before they even have the chance to cross the Mediterranean in an attempt to reach Italy.&nbsp; Stopping immigration is a top priority of the new government of Paolo Gentiloni and his centre-left Democratic Party.&nbsp; African News Agency
