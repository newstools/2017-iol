DURBAN – The Sharks have suffered a setback ahead of the new season after loose forward Keegan Daniel was ruled out for 12 weeks with a hand injury. He suffered the problem last Friday in a pre-season clash with the Cheetahs at the King Zwelithini Stadium, which the Cheetahs won 37-7. Daniel had to leave the action with an injury to his right hand, and subsequent scans determined that he had a fractured radius and needed to undergo an operation on Saturday morning. He’s expected to be out for approximately 12 weeks which is a blow to the Sharks squad. On the game itself in Umlazi, Sharks head coach Robert du Preez said: “It was a good start to our journey, and I was pleased with the squad’s fitness. They obviously didn’t have game time during our pre-season, and we wanted to see how they would go. “Our general execution was good despite the humid conditions, and we’re pleased with the enthusiasm and energy showed by our relatively young squad.” African News Agency (ANA)
