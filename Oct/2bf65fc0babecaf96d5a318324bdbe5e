JOHANNESBURG – Itumeleng Khune has won the Absa Premiership Player of the Month award for the period of August and September. “The last time I won this was three seasons ago,” said an elated Khune after having received the award in Durban. “I dedicate this honour to the entire Kaizer Chiefs family, as without a combined team effort, I would never have won this.” Khune had a string of brilliant performances for Amakhosi during August and September, which saw him win the Man of the Match awards for three successive matches – against Cape Town City, Maritzburg United and Golden Arrows. The judges felt that Khune’s displays were impressive and that he kept his team together during this time. They also noted that he stood out for his leadership qualities. “It’s a motivation to be recognised and it makes every player work harder,” added the Glamour Boy.   “However, with every achievement comes responsibility. I look ahead to work hard with the team to win more trophies for the club.” Khune also walked away with R5 000 prize money. African News Agency (ANA)
