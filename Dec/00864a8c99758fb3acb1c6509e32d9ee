JOHANNESBURG – Mamelodi Sundowns defender Sibusiso Kumalo is patiently waiting for his chance of breaking into coach Pitso Mosimane’s starting berth. Kumalo has been sparingly used at Sundowns since making the move from Moroka Swallows to Sundowns four years ago. As a Sundowns’ player, Kumalo has made merely 21 appearances, with most of those coming when he was on loan at Maritzburg United and Jomo Cosmos respectively. In spite of the little impact he’s had at the team so far, the 26-year-old argues that he’s ready to fight for his place in The Brazilians’ squad. In a star-studded team like Sundowns, Kumalo competes for a spot with the likes of Wayne Arendse, Motjeka Madisha, Bangaly Soumahoro, Thabo Nthethe and Ricardo Nascimento, who is rumoured to be leaving Masandawana. Kumalo’s pursuit for game time in Sundowns colours has at times been hindered by injuries.  He’s featured only in one game for the senior team last season, in a PSL encounter against Bethlehem-based side Free State Stars, which has resulted in him playing a huge role in helping the reserve team win the MultiChoice Diski Challenge. In the current season, the former Swallows midfielder has suffered the same fate as his previous seasons with the club – starting the season with an injury, and he’s yet to feature for the first team and has thus far made three appearances with the struggling reserve team.

The Katlehong-born footballer is in the first six months of his new contract with the club – he has a three-year deal, plus a two-year extension option – that he struck late last season. With Sundowns set to endure a busy New Year schedule – where they will fight for the PSL title, and with the Caf Champions League also starting – Kumalo will be hoping to play a role in the team’s pursuit for honours.  @Mihlalibaleka  IOL Sport Like IOL Sport on Facebook
