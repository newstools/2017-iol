Johannesburg - Thirty people were injured in two separate accidents involving minibus taxis in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday morning, paramedics said. Eleven people were injured early on Saturday morning when a panel van and a minibus taxi collided at the Houtkop and Van Riebeeck roads intersection in Vereeniging in Gauteng, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find the taxi on its side on the side of the road. The panel van was found parked a short distance away. Several passengers from the taxi were found on the scene. Paramedics assessed the injured and found that 11 had sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate.

The patients were treated for their injuries and thereafter transported to Sebokeng and Kopanong hospitals for further treatment, Meiring said. In the second incident, 19 people were injured when a minibus taxi veered off the road and crashed into a ditch along the Table Mountain Road near Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal, he said. ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene at 9.35am and found the taxi on the side of the road. The passengers had already managed to climb out of the vehicle.

The patients were treated for their injuries and thereafter transported to Northdale and Edendale provincial hospitals for further care, Meiring said.  African News Agency
