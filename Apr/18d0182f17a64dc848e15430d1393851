Cirencester, England – Mitsubishi’s UK division decided that the Japanese carmaker’s line-up could do with a bit more spice, and has created a new ‘Special Vehicle Projects’ programme, abbreviated SVP. First to get SVP treatment is Mitsubishi’s one-tonne bakkie, the L200 (sold as the Triton in SA and elsewhere), and it takes the sporty-looking fight to Ford's Ranger Wildtrak. Although no performance mods are on the cards, the SVP vehicles will get “significant appearance changes and specific colour options”. To that end, the SVP bakkie gets a unique black grille to go with the new black alloys, wheel arch extensions and matching black finish on the headlight and taillight bezels, roof rails and rear bumper. The cabin has also been livened up with, among other things, 'six-pack’ leather seats with suede-like ‘Alston’ inserts and embroidered SVP logos.  It’s based on the ‘Barbarian’ spec L200, which is powered by Mitsubishi’s 133kW 2.4-litre turbodiesel engine. Volumes will be limited to 250 units, finished in Electric Blue Metallic or Cosmos Black, and for now they’re for UK customers only, although there’s no saying that if those back at HQ are impressed, the rest of the world might also be treated to some tarted up Tritons. One only has to look at how many Ford Ranger Wildtraks there are on the roads...
