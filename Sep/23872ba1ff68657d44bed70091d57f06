Johannesburg - Mahindra is better known for tough-as-nails bakkies than for candidates on Top Gear’s ‘cool wall’, but these two new derivatives might just do something to redress that imbalance. Mahindra has upped the cool quotient of its KUV100 SUV with a two-tone colour scheme in either red with a black roof, or silver with a black roof. A revised, all-black interior colour scheme and special 15 inch diamond-cut alloy rims are also part of the deal. The KUV100 Two-Tone will only be available only with the 61kW/115Nm, 1.2-litre mFalcon petrol four, and in range-topping K8+ specification, which includes idle-stop technology and daytime running lights. It’s available now at R193 995 (R6000 more than the monochrome K8 petrol) which includes a three-year or 100 000km warranty and a three-year or 50 000km service plan.
