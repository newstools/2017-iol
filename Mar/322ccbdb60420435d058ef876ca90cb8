Member of Mayoral Committee Michael Sun said in a statement the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officer was shot at about 12:20pm. Sun said the injured officer was taken to hospital and is in a stable condition, but remains in ICU. "Two JMPD officers were conducting a stop-and-search as part of a visible policing exercise on Freedom Drive in Ivory Park Extension 2," Sun said. "When they indicated that a suspicious looking white bakkie pull over, the four male occupants stopped, exited the vehicle, and one gunman fired his R5-automatic rifle at the officers. The officers returned fire with their 9mm service pistols." Sun said one of the officers was shot in the arm and leg. "The suspects fled the scene and the vehicle was later recovered at Tembisa Hostel. Unfortunately no arrests have been made yet." Sun said during further investigation, it was revealed that the suspects had also robbed a business near where the officers were conducting their stop-and-search operation. This is the second incident in recent weeks in which JMPD officers have been shot at with R5-automatic rifles. Sun said this was cause for concern that criminals in the City were using Assault Rifles. "We will continue with our visible policing operations and request that members of the public contact us on 0113755911 if they have any information regarding yesterday's incident," Sun said.
