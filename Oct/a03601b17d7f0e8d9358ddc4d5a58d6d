DURBAN – Talks between Mamelodi Sundowns and their star forward Khama Billiat over a contract extension are in progress. That is according to Billiat’s agent, Siyabulela Loyilane, who dismissed a suggestion that the player is delaying a contract renewal with Sundowns because he wants to leave as a free agent in June. Billiat’s contract with Sundowns is set to expire in June. In January, he can sign a pre-contract with the club of his choice. “The talks are in still in progress with Sundowns. It is not true that Billiat doesn’t want to renew because he wants to leave for free. People must understand that contractual issues are not easy. There are terms and conditions that we have to take into consideration. “There is still time, we are not in a hurry. The player is happy at Sundowns. Did you see the goal he scored this weekend? Does it suggest he is not happy? Of course not,” Loyilane explained. Billiat scored a scorcher against Platinum Stars to earn Sundowns the maximum points this past weekend at Royal Bafokeng Stadium. “Teams must respect Sundowns. Billiat is still contracted to Sundowns, and if teams want him, they must talk to them. Sundowns deserve respect. “If Billiat is to leave Sundowns, both parties need to be happy. Sundowns must get what is due to them,” Loyilane said. Sundowns boss Pitso Mosimane has already made it clear that Billiat is ready to go to Europe, but a deal needs to happen for the player to leave. Billiat has already delivered six trophies for Sundowns during his four-year stay. @minenhlecr7  IOL Sport Like IOL Sport on Facebook
