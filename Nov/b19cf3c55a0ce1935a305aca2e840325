Cape Town - An alleged drunk driver recklessly led police on a chase from Green Point to Hout Bay last week. A traffic officer leaving the Gallows Hill Driving Licence Testing Centre in Green Point just after 9pm on Thursday spotted a driver spinning his wheels as he turned onto Somerset Road. But when the policeman activated his blue lights in an attempt to pull the driver over, the suspect then sped off towards Camps Bay. Officers responding to the subsequent call for back-up cornered him near the 12 Apostles Hotel and Spa, but he refused to switch off the engine or open the window - instead forcing his way through the vehicles boxing him in. The chase ended when the driver turned into a cul de sac at the Hout Bay Fire Station, and was charged for driving under the influence of alcohol as well as for reckless and negligent driving. Reckless and drunk with 21 kids on board In another incident on Friday, an officer on patrol along the N2, before Borcherds Quarry Road, saw the driver of a white Toyota Quantum taxi driving recklessly with 21 children on board. After being stopped, driver was found to be more than four times over the legal limit. He had been transporting the children to schools in the CBD. Mayco Member for Safety and Security; and Social Services, Alderman JP Smith, says “these types of incidents are becoming far too commonplace”. “It speaks to a complete disregard for law and order, but also the lives of others. Sadly, I don’t think we’ll see a change in behaviour until we see the type of sanctions handed down in the courts that are commensurate with the arrogance our enforcement staff encounter on the roads on a daily basis.” Daily Voice
