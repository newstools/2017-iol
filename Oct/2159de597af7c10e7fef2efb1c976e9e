Augrabies Falls National Park is the perfect weekend retreat for travellers wanting to enjoy nature in its purest form. The park was established in 1966 and has proven to be a popular spot for South Africans. Here are some ideas on how to spend a weekend: Book a chalet or opt for camping Nothing sounds better than spending a weekend out camping or in a self catering facility. Camping starts from R250pp and the self catering facilities start from R1090. The units are kitted with a lounge, bedroom, kitchen and braai facilities. Take a trip to the waterfall Augrabies Falls on the Orange River is around 56 metres in height. It is known as one of Northern Cape’s best kept secrets. Park visitors will need to pay a conservation fee. The prices will be available at the park’s reception. The waterfall will make for stunning photographs. Go on a game drive While you may not spot the Big 5 at this national park, guests can see giraffe, mountain zebra, springbok, eland, red hartebeest and klipspringer. Guests can book with the park for guided or self drives. Eat Guests who do not feel like preparing meals in their self catering cottage can visit the Quiver Tree Restaurant that offers breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Go on a walking trail For those who like nature and love to exercise while on a trip can opt to do a walking trail. People visiting during October to March can go on the Dassie Nature Trail, a 5km self-guided hiking trail.
