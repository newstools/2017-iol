Johannesburg Passenger train services between Randfontein and Robinson, west of Johannesburg, were suspended on Monday morning after a person was hit by a train, Metrorail said. Spokesperson Lilian Mofokeng said it was believed that the person had committed suicide. &quot;The person is currently lying on the tracks and train service from Randfontein to Robinson has been suspended until the police have finished their investigation,&quot; Mofokeng said. &quot;All Randfontein trains from Johannesburg are turning around at Krugersdorp.&quot; Mofokeng said Metrorail was looking at making buses available to run between Randfontein and Robinson. &quot;Commuters in this corridor are therefore informed to expect train delays of up to 60 minutes until the line is cleared.&quot; Metrorail apologised for the inconvenience and condemned the practice of illegal crossing of railway lines.
