Wuhu, China - Chinese carmaker Chery will be gunning for the automotive big league with a new nameplate for the European market. We don’t even know its name yet, but it is certainly making some bold promises. The first fruits of this project will be seen in the form of an all-new SUV which Chery will reveal in near-production form at the Frankfurt Motor Show next month. While we don’t know any concrete details about the product as yet, the carmaker is promising that it will not only meet the expectation of European car buyers in terms of design, dynamics, practicality, quality and safety, but that it will also be fun to drive and offer “class-leading” connectivity. The the company also plans to sell a range of hybrid and electric vehicles. Chery is currently setting up a new R&D facility in Europe, which will play an instrumental part in Geely’s global expansion. We’re still awaiting word on whether the new brand will be introduced to South Africa, but given our market’s more sophisticated tastes, it would surely be a no brainer. IOL Motoring
