Cape Town - Hundreds of people, led by the group of Elders, had gathered in the Cape Town CBD on Tuesday afternoon for a symbolic march on Nelson Mandela International Day to honour the global icon and also to launch a new global project, “Walk Together”. Led by Mandela’s widow, Graça Machel, the Elders, accompanied by a large group of local residents, had gathered at the Cape Town City Hall, where Mandela made his first speech on his release from prison in 1990, and were set to walk to the Cape Town International Convention Centre. Machel took to the podium and said "thank you so much for your presence here", before leading the crowd in a song wishing Madiba, who died in 2013, a happy birthday. The Elders, a group of global leaders founded by Mandela, and made up of former heads of state, peace activists, and human rights advocates, including Kofi Annan, Ban Ki-moon, Desmond Tutu, Graça Machel, Jimmy Carter, Hina Jilani, Mary Robinson, and Ernesto Zedillo among others, is also celebrating a decade since its founding.
