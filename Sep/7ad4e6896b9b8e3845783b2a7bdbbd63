Duchess Catherine has reportedly been scoffing spicy food and sugary sweets throughout her third pregnancy. The 35-year-old royal is expecting her third child with her husband Prince William, with whom she already has four-year-old son Prince George and two-year-old daughter Princess Charlotte, and, although she's been riddled with severe morning sickness, her body has been telling her to scoff hot curries and lots of sugary sweets. A source told the Daily Star newspaper: "Kate has always wanted a third child. She has been trying for another baby for months... she is suffering from nausea and morning sickness again, and she cannot stop eating spicy food and candy." The couple - who got married in 2011 - announced their baby news last week after the brunette beauty was forced to pull out of a royal engagement due to sickness - something she was hospitalised with during her two previous pregnancies. But the royal family - including Prince Harry and Prince Charles - found out about the happy news a while back and Queen Elizabeth, who will be the unborn tot's great-grandmother, is said to be "ecstatic" that there's a new little one joining the clan. The insider explained: "Kate has talked to Queen Elizabeth about her motherhood plans, and she has been incredibly supportive. Her majesty is just delighted that Kate has turned out to be such a star for the royal family. After all the scandals from the past, the queen is glad Kate has brought stability to the family." And Prince Harry - the brother of William - can't wait to become an uncle again. He said recently of the baby news: "[It's] fantastic, great. Very, very happy for them."
