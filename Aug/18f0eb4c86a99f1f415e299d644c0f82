Sarandon, 70, uploaded pictures of her about to paraglide along the Atlantic Seaboard, as well as a scenic picture of Hout Bay, on Instagram. She posted a picture of the colourful homes in the Bo-Kaap, captioning it “Cape Town”. Sarandon has been touring Africa, posting images of her trips to Uganda and Kenya. She captioned one of her snaps on July 21: “Headed to Africa with family to honour my brother Terry. See *  there.” Terry died on May 19 last year from a heart attack. Haniem Paleker had a chance encounter with Sarandon at the Waterfront. Paleker, who works in the shopping mall’s marketing and information department, said Sarandon had seemed relaxed. “I was walking through the mall and I recognised her voice. I walked closer and said her name. I asked her how she was doing and she walked off,” she said. “She was with three other ladies, no bodyguards. I walked after her and asked if I could take a picture with her and she agreed. “I asked her what she was doing in South Africa and she said she was on vacation. “She also asked me how I was. She was very relaxed, browsing at the shops.” Last year, L’Oréal Paris welcomed  Sarandon to the French cosmetic company’s “Dream Team” of brand ambassadors. “When L’Oréal Paris and (brand global president) Cyril Chapuy first approached me, I was so flattered,” Sarandon said in a statement. “The very first time I heard ‘Because I’m Worth It’, it definitely was a shift in the framing of why you should look good. “It had to do with women becoming the master of their own lives and decisions. It’s an extremely powerful statement.” Weekend Argus Sunday
