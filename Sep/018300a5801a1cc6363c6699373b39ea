Search the #ShareTheBay hashtag on social media and you would see thousands of images of Port Elizabeth, Uitenhage, Despatch and surrounding areas through the eyes of travellers. In celebration of Tourism Month this September, the Nelson Mandela Bay Tourism(NMBT) launched the #ShareTheBay exhibition at the Athenaeum’s Athol Fugard Terrace on Thursday. According to Nelson Mandela Bay Tourism, the hashtag has generated over 13 912 images under the #ShareTheBay hashtag. The platform allows travellers and locals to share their best places and what makes them special. Following the success of the first, visitors can visit the exhibition where they will see prints of the 10 selected photographers. Those who fall in love with some of the prints can purchase them. The sale and profits will go towards sponsoring a group of underprivileged youth on a tour to Addo Elephant National Park, a popular tourist spot in Port Elizabeth. NMBT‘s CEO, Mandlakazi Skefile, says that #ShareTheBay campaign is a motivation for local and domestic visitors to feel ownership with tourism and for them to explore their hometown. “Digital and social media has assisted NMBT in their goal of reaching a global market, creating local ambassadors and uplifting industry stakeholders and the creative arts within the community.
“The exhibition, which will be held at the historical and cultural Athenaeum, promoting the emerging creative industry since the 1850s, will feature the captivating natural beauty, heritage, culture and rich history of Nelson Mandela Bay through the eyes of 10 local Instagrammers, bloggers, photographers and creatives from all walks of life,” she says. Skefile said the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality will review its tourism development strategy and its approach to tourism product development.
