Frankfurt Motor Show - Audi’s RS4 Avant is continuing its fine tradition of lugging loads at ludicrous speeds with the debut of the all-new version, which is due to hit world markets in 2018. As you’d have expected, it follows the RS5 Coupe in ditching its predecessor’s V8 for a Porsche-engineered 2.9-litre twin-turbo V6, rated at 331kW and 600Nm. That, Audi says, is enough to launch you from zero to 100km/h in just 4.1 seconds and, if you order the RS dynamic package, the electronic speed limiter is raised to allow 280km/h. Power goes to all four wheels through an eight-speed Tiptronic gearbox and quattro all-wheel-drive, and Audi also offers a sport differential, for distributing drive between the back wheels, as well as RS sport suspension plus with Dynamic Ride Control. The RS4 Avant rides on 19-inch wheels (20” rims are optional) and the car sits seven millimetres lower to the ground than regular A4s. The styling kit was inspired by the 90 Quattro IMSA GTO racing ancestor, and includes the typical RS honeycomb air inlets, 30mm-wider wheel arches and an RS-specific diffuser and exhaust pipes. Matrix LED headlights are optional. Inside it moves with the Audi times with all the latest A4 electronics, including the Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, and stand-out RS items include RS sports seats and a flat-bottomed steering wheel. Audi South Africa confirms the local introduction of the RS4 Avant in the second half of 2018. Pricing will be announced closer to the time.   IOL Motoring
