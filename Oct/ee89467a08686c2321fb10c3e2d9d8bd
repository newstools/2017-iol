Cape Town - Talented hip-hop dancers Kiara Hall and Sithara Naidoo from Blouberg International School in Parklands will be representing South Africa at the World Fitness and Hip-Hop Unite Championships in Leiden, The Netherlands, next week. The girls will be competing in the World Championship duo category. The Grade 5 girls are 11 years old and are passionate about dance and music. “We’ve been dancing together for eight months. It’s really nice because we get along. Sometimes it’s really scary when you have to do it by yourself, but with a partner it’s better,” Hall said. The two said they had been dancing since they were young, and dancing was their way of expressing themselves. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Both girls have competed in other competitions nationally, and have come first several times. They are excited about showing off their talent to an international audience. “We practise two to three hours every day with our coach. We’re nervous and excited for the competition,” said Naidoo, who will also compete in the Freestyle Solo Battles. The headmistress of Blouberg International School, Edna Carolissen, said she wished the girls the best of luck, and success in the competition. “They are in sync whenever they do a certain style or motion. You can see that they feel it. We’re very proud of them,” Carolissen said Last night the girls were handed their South African colours at an SA Sport and Fitness Federation ceremony in Durbanville. They travel to The Netherlands to perform on October19 and 20.  naledi.mohono@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
