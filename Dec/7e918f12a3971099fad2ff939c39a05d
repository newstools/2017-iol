Israel-based designer Inbal Dror announced she was contacted by Kensington Palace to create the marital gown the former 'Suits' actress will wear when she ties the knot to fiancé Prince Harry next year, and the creative mastermind has already sent a sketch of the garment to Meghan to consider.  A spokesperson for the label told PEOPLE: "We received a request from the royal family to send a sketch." However, Dror and the newly engaged couple have remained tight-lipped about the details of the wedding dress.  The spokesperson added: "Unfortunately it's a secret and I can't give more details about the sketch."  Dror has previously designed gowns for fellow celebrities, including Beyonce and actress Naomi Watts.  Dror's designs are known to be ornately designed and regularly feature embellishment, as well as sheer panel detail and plunge necklines.  However, Dror's garments are hard to find in the UK as they are only stocked in one boutique named Morgan Davies, although she boasts a flagship store in Tel Aviv, as well as more stockists in America.  This news comes shortly after fashion designer Victoria Beckham was said to be keen to make Meghan's dress for her and Harry's nuptials on May 19, 2018.  A separate source previously said: "Victoria's dream is to design Meghan's wedding dress - and she's determined to achieve it. Victoria is a very savvy businesswoman. She knows that getting Meghan on board early on would be an all-round winner for her and her brand - it would be as good as receiving the royal seal of approval on her designs." Here are some snaps on Dror's work:
