Cheapflights  has given ‘Esc’ keyboard keys everywhere a new lease of life with the launch of its innovative EscEscape (pronounced ‘Escape Escape’) browser extension tool, putting a range of short getaway options just two-taps away from users.  Launching in the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and South Africa, ‘EscEscape’ is a free-to- install extension for Google Chrome users. When a user taps their keyboard ‘Esc’ key twice, a live flight search runs to find the cheapest, quickest and smartest return flights to nearby destinations. Results are pulled from Cheapflights’ own search engine API and the users’ nearest airport is detected as their departure airport. The flight results open in a new browser tab and will be the cheapest option for a weekend break in the next eight weeks. The user is then free to go ahead and book if they like the look of what they see – if not, another ‘double tap’ of the Esc key throws up a new option.  “We want people to rediscover their ‘Esc’ key, and make it their shortcut to escaping for real - double tap quick,” said Andrew Shelton, Cheapflights’ Managing Director.  Initially, a choice of five destinations will be featured each day, selected at random from the top 200 searched-for holiday hot spots on the Cheapflights website and app, per market. For the UK, US, Canada and South Africa, only flights within a five-hour flight time are selected. For flights departing from Australia and New Zealand, flights within an eight-hour flight time are selected, giving people popular getaway destinations such as Fiji.
