DURBAN – Allan Freese has been shown the door at Royal Eagles. Independent Media has been reliably informed that Freese was shown the door on Sunday. The former Platinum Stars coach joined Eagles towards the end of last season. He replaced Kostadin Papic. “Freese has been fired. The club bosses were not happy with the results and the type of football that the team are playing. The chairman Sbu Mpisane was not a big fan of Freese. He hired him because he was told that he is capable of bringing good results without playing vigilant football,” a well-placed source stated. Eagles are second from bottom in the National First Division log. They have drawn three matches and lost one. Freese confirmed that he is no longer the coach at Eagles. “What do you want from me, because I’m no longer the coach. We parted ways with Eagles yesterday,” Freese explained. Eagles lost 2-1 to University of Pretoria in the weekend. They are still searching for the first win of the season. Independent Media has gathered that Owen da Gama and Serame Letsoaka, who are also chasing the Chippa United coaching job, are also keen on the Royal Eagles post. Da Gama seems to be leading the race for the vacant post. @minenhlecr7  IOL Sport
