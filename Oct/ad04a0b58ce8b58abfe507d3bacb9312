A ninth career century by Heinrich Klaasen ensured the Titans enjoyed the advantage after the opening day of their Sunfoil Series clash against the Warriors at Willowmoore Park in Benoni on Friday.
 
The home captain made 133 (215 balls, 8x4, 4x6) to help his side reach the close of the round three clash on 310/7.
 
AB de Villiers made just five on his return to first-class duty, while the next best score after Klaasen was the 41 by Farhaan Behardien.
 
The Titans had won the toss at the start, but they found themselves in some early trouble on 62/3.
 
But the skipper and Behardien then put on 104 for the fourth wicket, before Henry Davids and Shaun von Berg chipped in with 34 apiece.
 
However, there was an opening for the visitors after Malusi Siboto had to retire hurt on 12, leaving just the tail to come.
 
Kolpak player Simon Harmer marked his first appearance of the season by taking 4/99, while Tladi Bokako managed 2/38, including the prized scalp of Proteas star De Villiers. Cricket South Africa
