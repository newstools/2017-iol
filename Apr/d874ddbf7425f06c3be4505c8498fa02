Suzuki’s Indian subsidiary has unveiled its all-new Dzire compact sedan and although it might still divide opinion, its design appears to be more resolved than that of the current model. You might also notice that it no longer has ‘Swift’ in its name, but the stubby little sedan is very evidently based on the new-generation Suzuki Swift hatch that was revealed toward the end of last year. Small sedans are big business in India, where a separate luggage compartment is regarded as a status symbol. It makes sense then that Maruti Suzuki would give the new version a more distinct identity. The new four-door also has a different dashboard design to its hatch sibling, although it does share its new touch-screen infotainment system which will probably only be available on higher-end models, given the car’s budget status. The new Dzire will reportedly be powered by the same normally aspirated 1.2-litre engine that serves in today’s car, and Indian customers will also have the option of a 1.3-litre turbodiesel. The latter would certainly make a nice addition to the local range. On that note, given that the new Swift hatch, which is also likely to be sourced from India, is only set to reach local shores in 2018, it’s unlikely that we’ll see this new sedan in showrooms any time before that.
