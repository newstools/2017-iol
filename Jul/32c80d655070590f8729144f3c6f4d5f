CAPE TOWN – Laura Wolvaardt and former captain Mignon du Preez both hit half-centuries to push South Africa up to 218/6 in the first ICC Women’s World Cup semi-final against England at Bristol on Tuesday. Despite losing her opening partner Lizelle Lee (7) early on in the innings, the 18-year-old schoolgirl Wolvaardt remained calm to score 66 off 100 balls – her third half-century of the tournament. Wolvaardt and Du Preez (76 not off 95 balls) combined for a 77-run partnership that took South Africa up to 125/2 in the 31st over, but the loss of the teenager when she was clean bowled by England captain Heather Knight had a huge impact on the Proteas’ chances of posting a big total. It was further dented when all-rounder Marizanne Kapp was run out in the same over as England further tightened the noose. Proteas captain Dane van Niekerk (27 off 39 balls, 3x4, 1x6) attempted to lift the run-rate with a cameo towards the backend of the innings but she too was run out at a crucial juncture of the innings. The stage was set for big-hitting Chloe Tryon to unleash a few hefty blows, but the KwaZulu-Natal all-rounder could not replicate her pyrotechnics display in the earlier round-robin match against England when she smashed a 25-ball half-century. All she could manage was a single before being caught and bowled by Jenny Gunn. Du Preez battled valiantly throughout to break the shackles and eventually put on an unbroken partnership of 48 for the seventh wicket with the bustling Sune Luus (20 not out) to give South Africa’s bowlers something to defend. “It (the pitch) is a lot slower since the last time we played. Wicket-to-wicket is the way to go. I definitely think we have our plans covered and looking forward to us defending this total. It wasn’t easy and we are going to put them under pressure,” Du Preez said after the innings. IOL Sport
