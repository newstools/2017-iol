Johannesburg - The ANC’s head of policy Jeff Radebe says the party will be looking at beefing up measures to ensure proper accountability for the implementation of the National Development Plan (NDP). 
 
Radebe was speaking at the ANC’s policy conference in Soweto on Saturday and outlined the progress the government has made in implementing the NDP, which should be completely implemented by 2030. 
 
He has presented the progress report to ANC delegates so they could keep the targets in mind as they head to various commissions to discuss and debate the party’s plans for the next five years. 
 
Radebe conceded that implementation of the NDP has been slow, but said there were a number of successes that have put in place so far in the mid term.
