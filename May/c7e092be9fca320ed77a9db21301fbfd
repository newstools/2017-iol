 LONDON – Kell Brook took time out from preparing for his super-fight at Sheffield United’s football ground to try to goad Amir Khan into agreeing to their long-awaited showdown, which would fill Wembley Stadium. As he lazed in the Canary Islands sunshine between training sessions prior to defending his world welterweight title against America’s Errol Spence Jnr on May 27, Brook reflected on a bizarre appearance by Khan on GMTV back in England. After hearing that Khan, accompanied by his wife, had apologised on air for a video of a personal sex act which had appeared on the internet, Brook said: "He’s a media whore. It’s comical. He’s become Amir Kardashian. He has so much drama around him. He’s in the papers for the wrong reasons." As Brook moves on to his battle with Spence following his KO by Gennady Golovkin, he sees Khan’s career marooned since his stoppage by Canelo Alvarez. He says: "He’s a bit skint now, some problem with his dad. I think he wants this big-money fight. He knows I will beat him up, but he may be willing to take his doing for the money." Spence has been training at Khan’s gym in Bolton, further irking Brook, who said: "Helping my opponent is typical of Amir, but he can’t help Spence when I meet him in the ring." Daily Mail
