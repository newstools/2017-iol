Multi-billionaire and Microsoft founder Bill Gates has named South Africa's Rhythm City as his favourite soap opera.The e.tv drama comes in at number 5 in a blog post by Gates titled Five Reasons I'm Hopeful About Africa.Under the heading My Favourite Soap Opera, Gates explains why he loves the soapie saying that &quot;the show it really brings home how far South Africa has come since the end of apartheid&quot;.Gates says: &quot;When I was in South Africa last year for the International AIDS Conference, I caught a fascinating TV show one night. The show is called 'Rhythm City' and it s the most popular soap opera in South Africa. &quot;The show, which has characters speaking in the four main languages of South Africa (Xhosa, Zulu, English, and Afrikaans), revolves around people trying to break into the music industry. &quot;Some of the storylines are a bit out there (it is a soap opera, after all), but when you see the show it really brings home how far South Africa has come since the end of apartheid. &quot;You take a step into the lives of everyday South Africans who are dealing with the relationship and business issues you d see anywhere in the world. As the continent continues to develop and thrive, I predict we ll see many other shows like this in other countries.&quot;Last year Gates delivered the keynote address at the 14th Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture Series in Pretoria and spoke at the International HIV/Aids conference in Durban.Last year the philanthropist pledged to donate another $5 billion (R72.8bn) to Africa in the next five years with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation reportedly having already invested more than $9 billion in Africa.
