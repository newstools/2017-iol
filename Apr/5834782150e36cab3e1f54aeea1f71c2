Angry protesters flooded parliament's gates in protest following Zuma's controversial cabinet reshuffle last week. The masses held SA flags flying in the Cape Town wind and placards saying Zuma must fall amongst others. One of the many protesters, Matt Laird said that people are there to get rid of president Zuma and his cabinet. "We are coming together as the country to let those in authority know that we want Zuma out because we love this country and if we don't stand up the economy of this country will go down." He said that he does not think the march will change anything because it's not only Zuma that is the problem in the African National Congress. "I hope people won't give up until the president resigns. I hope people can stay united as South Africans and keep on fighting this corruption that is happening in our country," Laird added.
