He said: "I booked the tour for October so I could have at least four months ... to just really bond and see their fingers and s**t like that. They’ll be with me [on tour] anyway, but I'm just saying, like, [I needed] a space where I'm not doing nothing, I'm just focused on them. I'm not thinking about a show at night or anything like that. That's why the tour is so far away from the release of the album." Bang Showbiz
