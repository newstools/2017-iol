Johannesburg South Africa has revoked its intention to withdraw its membership of the International Criminal Court (ICC), a notice from the United Nations has revealed. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, acting in his capacity as depositary, said South Africa had revoked the Instrument of Withdrawal from the Statute of the ICC &quot;with immediate effect&quot;. South Africa notified the UN of the decision after the Gauteng High Court last month issued a judgment blocking the move to leave the ICC because it had not been approved by Parliament.
