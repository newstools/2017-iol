Hyundai has released a teaser video starring its forthcoming Juke and CX-3 rival that’s set to be revealed later this year. Although Hyundai already has the Creta B-segment crossover competing in some emerging markets, including SA, the Kona looks set to be aimed more at Europe and perhaps even the US. The teaser pictures that we’ve seen thus far show us that it has a two-tiered front end design, somewhat reminiscent of the Jeep Cherokee and its likely rival, the Nissan Juke. Hyundai describes the exterior styling as “voluminous” and “aggressive”. Most of the details are still under wraps at this stage, but it’s likely, given the region Hyundai is pitching it at, that the Kona will be powered by Hyundai’s 1-litre, three-cylinder turbopetrol engine, 1.3 and 1.6 turbo units also possibly featuring in higher-powered models. Hyundai promises that the Kona will offer all the latest technologies and one feature it does mention is a head-up display with what it claims is class-leading luminance.
