Durban - A 30-year old man believed to be working as a spotter for local gangs has been arrested by police in Morningside, Durban on Tuesday afternoon. He was charged for contravening the telecommunications act, possession of suspected stolen property and defeating the ends of justice.  Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesperson, said the man was found in possession of emergency service two-way equipment. "The bust was made by members of the Provincial Organised Crime, National Intervention Unit, Metro Crime Prevention,  eThekwini Outer North Crime Intelligence. The suspect was caught right handed whilst monitoring these two way radios at an outbuilding. He will appear in the Durban Magistrates’ Court tomorrow," Zwane said. Zwane said officers swooped at an outbuilding following information about illegal monitoring of police and emergency services operations.  "For a week, officers monitored these illegal criminal activities after the police suspected that there might be someone who may be leaking information on police operations to criminals. While inside the out building the suspect was found with different  two way radios listening to activities by Metro police, SAPS and EMRS in their different channels. A total of 20 various two way radios were confiscated and will be used as exhibits," Zwane said.  Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, congratulated the members involved in an operation. “This is a testimony that police deployments and multi-disciplinary operations in the province are reaping good results. Investigations will continue as to how the two-way radios landed at the suspect’s hands,” he said. Daily News
