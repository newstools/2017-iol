The state power utility's BEE policy should be seen as a way to help correct inequalities, writes Floyd Shivambu. Despite the many challenges it faces, Eskom s policy that prescribes that a minimum of 50 percent of all coal-supplying companies should be black owned is one of the relatively progressive stances taken by a state-owned company in South Africa since 1994. It is progressive because it begins to appreciate that state-owned companies cannot be left to the vicissitudes of the markets, while ignoring the vivid socio-economic inequalities that define South Africa in the past and present.It is progressive because it begins to appreciate that state-owned companies cannot be left to the vicissitudes of the markets, while ignoring the vivid socio-economic inequalities that define South Africa in the past and present.This is so because historically, state-owned companies were used by the colonial-cum-apartheid governments as instruments to resolve the poor white problem in South Africa. There is therefore nothing wrong with using Eskom and all other state-owned companies to address the poor black problem in South Africa. While Eskom s 50% black ownership demand on all new coal contracts is a step in the right direction, it should appreciate that black economic empowerment in its current configuration is not the correct mechanism to deal with mass economic emancipation and empowerment.Often, BEE deals empower few individuals who recurrently benefit from huge corporations in a manner that does not trickle down to ordinary people. Black economic empowerment in the current configuration does not and will not resolve the poor black problem in South Africa, and has dismally failed to bridge the gap between rich and poor.The fact that BEE does not empower the majority of black people should, however, not serve as a way of discouraging an otherwise progressive policy position that a minimum of 50% black ownership should be sine qua non for all supplier companies to state-owned companies. The question and necessary debate should be on the composition, nature and form of the BEE participants in the companies that supply state-owned companies. The debate over economic empowerment in South Africa should shift towards a mechanism that will embrace and give practical meaning to employee share schemes and worker control of some of the huge corporations benefitting from the state. The view that workers in the supplier and state-contracted companies should own majority shares is far more important, and should be elevated into policy position not only in Eskom, but in all state-owned companies and the state procurement practices.All patriotic South Africans will agree, and this position is also not very far from the ruling party s now hollow manifesto commitment that 75% of goods and services procured by the state must be locally produced.The phenomenon of worker ownership and control is not alien even to the most advanced capitalist countries in the world, and is one of the mechanisms that should be implemented in South Africa as part of responding to the black poverty crisis. Worker control, ownership and subsequent benefits from companies they work for can serve as an important propellant to the South African economy because with additional income, workers will consume more goods and services and therefore stimulate real economic expansion.In the UK, there is a huge corporation bigger than the Pick n Pay and Shoprite Stores combined called John Lewis Partnership, which owns John Lewis department stores. John Lewis Partnership has a total turnover of more than R150 billion and employs more than 89000 workers and each of these workers receive dividends at the end of each financial year reflective of the profits gained by the partnership.The leadership of the John Lewis Partnership is elected democratically by the employees, and this corporation is the third- largest company in the UK in terms of sales. So it is not impossible to introduce a workable and profitable worker ownership and control model and mechanism, which will begin to benefit workers.Eskom s 50% commitment is a step in the right direction because it will begin to remove unnecessary multinational ownership and control over companies which otherwise could benefit many South Africans. It is therefore a huge surprise that when the acting Eskom chief executive was under attack from established capitalist mouthpieces and interests, no one came to his defence. Practically, all state-owned companies inclusive of Transnet, SAA, Denel and all companies with or without macro-economic significance should be encouraged and legislatively mandated to pass laws that will demand a minimum of 50% black and indigenous ownership in all companies that supply goods and services to state-owned companies and to the state. All political organisations should discuss and adopt a policy framework that will result in real economic empowerment of workers, and begin to deal decidedly with the poverty crisis.* Shivambu is the deputy president of the EFF.** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.The Sunday Independent
