Umzimkhulu - State security minister David Mahlobo has called on the private security industry to stop pushing for profits at the expense of lives in the fight against political killings in KwaZulu-Natal.
 
“When a political figure is shot and the rest are terrified, the municipality has to hire a private security company.
 
“Many hitmen come from the private security industry. It’s a job now. What kind of a business thrives on fear?” he asked.
 
Mahlobo asked private security to do their job with honesty and eliminate “rogue elements”.
 
He was addressing the community of Umzimkhulu on Thursday, with provincial and regional political leaders including religious leaders.
 
Former ANC Youth League secretary-general Sindiso Magaqa‚ now a councillor‚ and two of his colleagues‚ were attacked by unknown gunmen in Umzimkhulu‚ landing them in hospital. They became the fourth‚ fifth and sixth victims of violence in the area in recent months. As a result of intimidation and political killings, Mahlobo said municipalities in the province had procured the services of private security companies to protect officials.
 
“Some think this is a business opportunity... the more there is violence, it creates an opportunity.
 
“We don’t want these aspects of this industry where their integrity and conduct is unethical. These are issues we raise all the time,” Mahlobo said.
 
He said not all private security companies were involved, but added that others were taking advantage of the instability.
 
Mahlobo said the conduct was inhumane and asked that those who took part in the unethical practice be prayed for. The Mercury  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
