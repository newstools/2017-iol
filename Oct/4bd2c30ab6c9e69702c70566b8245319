500 ml (2 cups) flour
    
15 ml (3 T) baking powder

5 ml (1 t) vanilla essence Custard Filling 6 egg yolks
    
180 g (¾ cup) castor sugar
    
70 ml corn flour
    
500 ml (2 cups) milk

Heat milk and butter, but do not boil. Add vanilla essence and stir into batter.
    
Spoon into 2 x 20 cm greased cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes and remove from oven.
   
Whilst the cake layers are still hot, use a cotton thread and “cut” horizontally in halve. Place on a wire rack to cool.
    
In the meantime, make the custard filling: Beat the egg yolks and castor sugar together until light and foamy. Sift the corn flour and fold into the egg mixture.
    
Heat the milk until just below boiling and add, in a thin stream, to the egg mixture whilst beating constantly. Heat over medium heat until the mixture thickens. Stir constantly. Remove from heat and beat in the vanilla essence. Leave to cool. To assemble the cake: Divide custard into 4 portions and use as filling and topping for each cake layer.
   
Sprinkle with ground caramel, if desired.
