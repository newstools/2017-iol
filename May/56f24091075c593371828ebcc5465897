The executive board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will meet next month to ponder whether it is feasible to award the 2024 and 2028 Olympic Games when it meets in Lima in September. A working group consisting of the four IOC vice-presidents will deliver two reports on June 9 looking into the candidature process, one on the 2024 and 2028 Olympics and a second on the reform of the bidding procedure for the Olympic Winter Games in 2026. The group "has been tasked with exploring how to make the candidature procedure more proactive, more collaborative and less expensive in the future", the IOC said. Los Angeles and Paris are the two bidding cities for the 2024 Games, with both preferring to host the Olympics then. According to sources, the 95 IOC members who meet in Lima in September could be asked to vote on hosts for both the 2024 and 2028 Games. "Nothing but pure speculation," an IOC source told AFP. AFP
