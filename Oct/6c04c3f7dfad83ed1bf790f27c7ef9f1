The Financial Services Board (FSB) warns against conducting financial services business with TD Markets, which purports to be registered in the United Kingdom and Saint Vincent. TD Markets and its representative, George van der Riet, are not authorised to render financial services in South Africa and do not represent an authorised financial services provider, as required by the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, the FSB says. The FSB again reminds you to check whether the company with which you want to invest your money is an authorised provider. Call the FSB on its toll-free number (0800 110 443) or check on its website, www.fsb.co.za
