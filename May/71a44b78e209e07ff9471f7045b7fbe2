"South Africa looks forward to working with the French government under the leadership of Mr Macron to consolidate the already strong political, economic and trade ties between South Africa and France," said Zuma in a statement issued by Government Communications on behalf of the department of International Relations and Cooperation. France is an important source of foreign direct investment and also one of the highest sources of onward tourism for South Africa. Zuma said relations between SA and France were structured through a Strategic Partnership encompassing political, economic, social and defence matters. The two countries cooperate in a wide variety of fields, especially in education and training, environment, health, transport, energy, science and research, as well as arts and culture. "South Africa will continue to work with the French government under Mr Macron to implement existing agreements and explore new areas of cooperation for the mutual benefit of the South African and French people."
