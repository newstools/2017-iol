AKA landed in hot water following his tweets over the weekend when he suggested he wanted to help his nemesis Cassper to fill FNB Stadium. "I wanna do fill up FNB with Tsibip. It's time we put this shit to bed. It's 2017 guys ..." he tweeted. Let’s do it like, watch the throne style … each guy on either side of the stadium, on a crazy LED cube or whatever and go back to back," he added. Now AKA claims it’s his tweets that helped promote Cassper Nyovest’s Fill Up FNB Stadium concert. WATCH: Cassper Nyovest reveals he's 'too broke' to date Responding to a tweet from the East Coast drive time host Bongani Mtolo said AKA is trying to ride Cassper’s wave by wanting to partner with him on his latest quest to fill up the 75 000 seater on December 2. In a video clip, Mtolo said the two rivals must “carry on beefing”, and all encouraged fans to focus on the course at hand.  AKA who is not shy to voice out his opinion took to Twitter to respond  the allegations, stating that his “tweets actually helped promote the event” This type of divisive thinking is so unfortunate. Personally I think My tweets actually helped promote the event. Spread positivity. Not this. 🙏🏻 https://t.co/vFJOgmZA8S — AKA (@akaworldwide) November 14, 2017
