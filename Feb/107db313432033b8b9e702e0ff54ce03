Meetings Africa, the continent’s most respected meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions event will take place from 28 February to 1 March 2017. Its aim is to promote and position the country as Africa’s most sought-after business tourism destination.  Business tourism is a significant, growing element of tourism in the world, which generates $600 billion and sustains an estimated 62 million jobs worldwide annually.  Business travellers spend almost three times more than leisure travellers, and almost 6% of them will return to that destination as leisure tourists. Meetings Africa showcases the continent’s diverse offerings of services and products, where associations and meetings industry professionals join forces in order to uplift the business events sector within the continent.  The continent’s business events representatives, from local, regional and international associations, corporate, government and incentive business event buyers, will meet at the Sandton Convention Centre to network. Tourism KwaZulu-Natal Chief Executive Officer, Ndabo Khoza said Meetings Africa was a critical platform to engage with key partners in the tourism business sector. “Meetings Africa attracts over a thousand high calibre delegates from all over the world, with some 200 international buyers looking to secure venues for their big events, conferences and meetings,” he said. South Africa is currently ranked as the 38th most important destination for associations by the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA).
