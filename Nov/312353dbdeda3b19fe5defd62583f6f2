Mahikeng - A 46-year-old man accused of killing teenager Spencer Tshukudu in Blydeville appeared briefly in the Lichtenburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the North West province said. NPA spokesperson Frank Lesenyego said the case was postponed to January 31, 2018, for indictment and transfer to the high court. Jaco du Plooy of Rietfontein near Lichtenburg is accused of shooting Tshukudu, 15, on October 10 and injuring two others. He is facing a charge of murder and two of attempted murder. Du Plooy claimed he was attacked by a group of eight people and fired several shots to defend himself and his employees. The State alleges that he was not attacked and he opened fire on the teenager and his friends while they were diverting traffic to avoid a protest down the road about 700 metres away. Tshukudu was shot between the eyes. He died at the scene. Du Plooy was released on R20,000 bail in October. His bail was extended on Thursday.  African News Agency
