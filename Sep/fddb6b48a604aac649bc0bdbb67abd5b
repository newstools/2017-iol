Nurburg, Germany - Alfa Romeo’s Stelvio Quadrifoglio QV, due for release in South Africa during the first half of 2018, has set a new lap record for a production SUV at the Nurburgring. Test driver Fabio Francia - the same driver who also set the track record for a four-door sedan with the Giulia Quadrifoglio, went round the full 20.6km Nordschleife in 7m51.7s - a full eight seconds faster than the previous production SUV record. The Stelvio Quadrifoglio QV has an all-aluminium, direct-injection 2.9-litre twin-turbopetrol 90 degree V6 rated at 375kW and 600Nm, driving Alfa’s standard Q4 all-wheel drive system for the first time via an eight-speed automatic transmission, for which it quotes upshifts in just 150 milliseconds in Race mode, and a torque vectoring differential, and specially-tuned adaptive suspension. High-performance options for the QV include Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes and lightweight carbon-fibre Sparco racing seats for optimum lateral support in extreme cornering - check them out in the video.
