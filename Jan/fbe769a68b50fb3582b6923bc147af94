Manhattan - Jason Katz, a former Barclays currency trader, admitted conspiring to fix prices in the foreign-exchange market, the third individual to be charged and the first to plead guilty in a long-running US criminal investigation into the rigging of currency rates.Katz appeared in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, where he admitted to participating in a conspiracy with other bankers to manipulate emerging-market currency trades while working at three different financial institutions from 2007 to 2013.Katz s conviction comes one day before five banks are scheduled to be sentenced in connection with the Justice Department s three-year investigation. The banks - Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland Group - pleaded guilty in May 2015 to charges that their traders conspired to manipulate trading in U.S. dollars and euros. UBS Group also pleaded guilty to a related charge.Bloomberg previously reported that the currency-rigging investigation had expanded to additional chatrooms involving trading in emerging market currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and&nbsp;the South African rand.Trading historyKatz spent a year as director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading at Barclays beginning in 2010, according to regulatory filings and his LinkedIn profile. He joined BNP Paribas in September 2011 as its director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading, before leaving for Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group two years later, the documents show. Before joining Barclays, Katz spent more than nine years at Standard Bank, where he was head of foreign exchange, according to his LinkedIn profile.Prosecutors say Katz was a dealer of central and eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies and conspired to manipulate prices through &quot;non-bona fide trades,&quot; coordinating the placement of bids and offers, and agreeing on currency prices they would quote specific customers.Katz has agreed to cooperate with the government s investigation. The conspiracy charge Katz admitted to has a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine, which may be increased based on the proceeds gained or the loss to investors.Read also: Rand collusion: SA's antitrust boss digs in These conspirators engaged in blatant collusion and succeeded in manipulating exchange rates for multiple currencies to their advantage, said Brent Snyder, a deputy assistant attorney general with the department s antitrust division.
