Le Mans, France - After all the excitement about the Le Mans 24 Hours endurance race, here’s one for bike-racing fans: highlights of the Le Mans 24 Heures du Motos. That’s right, a 24 hour endurance race for superbikes held at the same venue a few weeks earlier - albeit on the 4.185 kilometre Bugatti Grand Prix circuit, rather than the 13.688km road-racing Circuit de la Sarthe, although they share the same pits and main straight. You’ll also see from the first video that - unlike the car racers, they still use the traditional Le Mans start, where the riders run across the main straight to their bikes, start up and go - with disastrous results for the Team Honda GB CBR1000RR SP2, as you’ll see from the last video, which is a behind-the-scenes look at the Team Honda effort.
