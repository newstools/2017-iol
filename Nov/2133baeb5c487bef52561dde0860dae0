There’s a new kid on the block in the craft gin scene, Mayine Premium Gin. Luvoyo and Nodumo Jongile have been passionate about gin for more than a decade and now they have bottled their love for the spirit. Based in Khayelitsha, the couple are launching their two gins this weekend, the Rooibos Infused Mayine Gin and the Grape Mayine Gin. With floral notes deeply rooted in South Africa, the Rooibos gin is described as having “an authentic flavour and is the result of the infusion of rooibos tea and honeybush botanicals, which are added post distillation.” The grape based gin is “ very smooth with a slight hint of jasmine and coriander on the palate. Light tones of buchu, rooibos and a hint of citrus can be picked up in the after taste.” The couple want to build on these two gins and expand their brand. Luvoyo says: “Our future plans are to create a unique gin by infusing it with different flavors. Once we are established, we will make use of different herbs to infuse it, for example “impepho” (incense used as an herb), because we want to make something that is authentic and organic. Something that describes all African cultures.” If you want to get a taste of this new gin check out mayinegin.co.za
