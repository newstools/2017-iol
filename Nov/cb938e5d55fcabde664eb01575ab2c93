Reeza Hendricks scored a maiden century as the Highveld Lions secured a thrilling last-ball victory over the Dolphins in their RamSlam T20 Challenge match in Potchefstroom on Sunday. Lions opener Hendricks ended unbeaten on 102 (72 balls, 12x4), but it was the composure of Wiaan Mulder that got them over the line after the visitors threatened to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Chasing 169 for victory, the home side were cruising along merrily on 158/0 – needing 11 from 11 balls – with Hendricks’ opening partner Rassie van der Dussen (57 runs off 42 balls, 5x4, 1x6) providing an excellent support act at Senwes Park. But Andile Phehlukwayo (2/26) dismissed the latter as well as Mangaliso Mosehle (0) first ball to leave the hosts with nine runs to win off the final over. Five came from the first three of Robbie Frylinck’s (1/35) over before two more batsmen fell in Nicky van den Bergh and Dwaine Pretorius, both for one, with Mulder facing and three needed off the last ball. The young all-rounder kept his cool to script a second win for the Lions that vaulted them to second on the standings. Earlier, the Dolphins needed a blistering unbroken 52-run seventh-wicket stand to give themselves hope after they had slumped to 116/6 with 3.1 overs to go. Morné van Wyk (42) was the only top-order batsman to shine, with Sibonelo Makhanya thumping 46 off 34 balls alongside Keshav Maharaj (10) to give the Durbanites hope. But it proved a few runs short as the home side made heavy work of what should have been a straightforward win. Cricket South Africa
