SUN CITY - Branden Grace shot a scintillating six-under 66 here on Sunday to win the 2017 edition of the Nedbank Golf Challenge, ending a 10-year trophy drought by the South Africans. Outstanding off the tee and hitting every green in regulation allowed the George-based golfer to make six birdies and no bogeys for a total of 11-under par, to win by one shot from third round leader Scott Jamieson, who posted a score of 70, to be at 10-under par.    France’s Victor Dubuisson was third after going around the Gary Player Country Club in 70 shots, for  a nine-under par score. China’s Li Haotong finished fourth after making eight birdies in a blemish-free round of 64 – the lowest of the week – for a score of seven-under par. @jacq_west  IOL Sport  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
