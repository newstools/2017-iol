Injera picked up the cruciate ligament tear in a league match in March and did not play in April's Singapore Sevens, won by Canada.

"We could not take a risk of taking him on the tour with that injury." Kenya are 11th in the World Series standing with 57 points this season but Simiyu remains positive for improvement.
