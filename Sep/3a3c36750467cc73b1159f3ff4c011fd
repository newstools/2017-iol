Linkin Park are to play a special tribute concert in honour of their late bandmate Chester Bennington. The five remaining members of the group will reunite for the first time on stage since Chester's untimely death in July to play a gig at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on October 27. Money raised from the concert will go to Music for Relief's One More Light Fund in memory of the late singer. The band also released a video for their track 'One More Light', which includes shots of Bennington onstage surrounded by his fans and behind the scenes when he is relaxing with his bandmates. Mike Shinoda said in a statement: "'One More Light' was written with the intention of sending love to those who lost someone. We now find ourselves on the receiving end.
"In memorial events, art, videos, and images, fans all over the world have gravitated towards this song as their declaration of love and support for the band and the memory of our dear friend, Chester. We are so very grateful and canâ€™t wait to see you again." Whilst DJ Joe Hahn - who was also responsible for directing the 'One More Light' video - added: "It has been incredibly emotional to work on this, and especially to watch it. I feel that by doing it, we not only faced some of our biggest fears, but it enabled us to use our talents to bring some light to people that need it. As we move forward to the Hollywood Bowl show and beyond, I think about the people that connect with the band, outside and inside our circle. This video is a gesture of good will to the people that want that connection." Tickets will go on sale for the concert at 10am PDT on Friday, September 22.
