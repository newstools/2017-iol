Johannesburg - The City of Johannesburg said on Thursday it would have to close some of its swimming pools due to a shortage of chemicals used to keep the water hygienic. The council said the affected pools were Florida Lake, Sydenham, Eastbank in Alexandra, Roodepoort, and Davidsonville. "Whilst this is regrettable as it deprives the residents of the affected areas access to the pools, I would like to assure the residents that this closure is done to ensure the health and safety of the bathers," Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Community Development, Nonhlanhla Sifumba said. "The procurement process for the chemicals is almost complete and should be concluded by the end of this week. The delays in the procurement process were caused by among others the open tender process on which the department embarked on to buy the pool chemicals." The City said the department was working to ensure that a qualifying service provider was appointed soon so that the chemicals could be ordered before businesses close for the Christmas holiday.
