Oversized chandeliers deck the ceiling surrounding the bar in the centre of the venue, giving a feel of opulence. I could picture a Victorian-themed party or even a disco birthday bash at this classy venue - it’s very adaptable. The service was good and the food pretty decent too. My Norwegian salmon was prepared delicately with mash on the side. You cannot go wrong with the sirloin steak and fries. Those fries were special - the addition of truffle oil makes all the difference. If you have a sweet tooth, you’re in luck. The dark chocolate bake was the perfect blend of bitter and sweet. It’s large enough to share but I'm not sure you're going to want to. The overall feeling of the restaurant is aesthetically pleasing; the chairs, bright decor and ambiance get my vote. I’d say it’s a great spot for a girls' night out.
