South Africa’s proudest mom re-entered the public spotlight because of her son Wayde van Niekerk’s world-record-shattering running skills, but her own athletic prowess is no secret.  On Friday, M-Net revealed that Swarts will be joining Thembisa Mdoda, Frank Opperman, Juanita de Villiers and Liesl Laurie as the most recently announced celebrity contestants on the upcoming South African version of the hit British reality show.  Long before her son was declared a South African Olympic icon, she also lit up the athletics world.  “Having competed provincially as a track-and-field athlete in the late 1980s and early 1990s, she too broke a number of sporting records, and will no doubt be determined to light up the gleaming dance floor in 2018,” said M-Net spokesperson Ingrid Engelbrecht. Swarts will hopefully prove that running ability can translate to the foxtrot, saying she is no stranger to competition and is keen to dance against her fellow cast members. “I always wanted to learn how to Tango and Salsa but with raising kids and the years flying by so fast I never got to it,” she said.  “My kids are now all grown up and I want to see this as my time to learn new things. I have loved the international seasons of the show and always wished that I could be part of something like that so this is an absolute dream come true,” she said. The channel is teasing audiences by slowly revealing the new contestants, with fans also asking who will be added to the judging panel.  The series will follow 12 untrained local celebrities and ask them to put their best foot forward with the help of highly skilled professional Latin and Ballroom dancers.  It’s set to run on DStv channel 101 from Sunday, February 4. Saturday Star
