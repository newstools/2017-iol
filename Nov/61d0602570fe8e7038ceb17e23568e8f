Hollywood star Henry Cavill has confessed that the approach of the DC Extended Universe "hasn't necessarily worked". The 34-year-old actor stars as Superman in the DC movies and while he acknowledges that the comic book films have proven to be profitable, he also understands why they haven't always been well received by fans and critics. READ: Joker and Harley Quinn spin-off to focus on love story Henry confessed: "Even if Marvel didn't exist, we'd struggle. There was a style they [DC] were going for, an attempt to be different and look at things from a slightly different perspective, which hasn't necessarily worked. "Yes, it has made money but it has not been a critical success; it hasn't given everyone that sensation which superheroes should give the viewer." Despite this, Henry believes the Patty Jenkins-directed 'Wonder Woman', which stars actress Gal Gadot, has shown the way forward for the DC Extended Universe. He said that the critically acclaimed movie marked the "first step in the right direction" for the franchise. Henry told Heroic Hollywood: "I think it is a wonderful time for the female hero. It is the perfect setting in social politics right now, we need it, we want that perspective, and 'Wonder Woman' has struck at the ideal time and has become a phenomenal success, which is fantastic. "Any success within the superhero universe, especially within the DC Universe, is wonderful, because I want to keep telling the Superman story; selfishly, that works for me. "I feel like now the right mistakes have been made and they haven't been pandered [to], and we can start telling the stories in the way they need to be told. "It is even better to come back from a mistake or stylistic error into the correct vein because it will make it seem that much stronger. 'Wonder Woman' was the first step in the right direction."
