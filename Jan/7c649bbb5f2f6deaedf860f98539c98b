The report marks the annual meeting of political and business leaders in Davos. The 47th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting will be held in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, between 17-20 January under the theme Responsive and Responsible Leadership . &nbsp;&nbsp; Oxfam s report, An economy for the 99 percent , shows the gap between rich and poor is greater than had been feared.

New and better data on the distribution of global wealth particularly in India and China indicates that the poorest half of the world has less wealth than had been previously thought. &nbsp;Had this new data been available last year, it would have shown that nine billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the planet, and not 62, as Oxfam calculated at the time. In South Africa, the richest 1 percent of South Africans have 42 percent of the total wealth. Three billionaires have the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50 percent of South Africa, it says. Such inequality is the sign of a broken economy, from global to local, and lack of will from government to change the status quo, said Oxfam SA Executive Director Sipho Mthathi. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
