CAPE TOWN – Springbok wing Bjorn Basson has signed with the Stormers for the 2017 Super Rugby season. The experienced outside back joins the Stormers from the Bulls, and will add valuable backline depth for head coach Robbie Fleck. Basson has amassed 95 Super Rugby caps and has scored an impressive 35 tries in that time, which illustrates his abilities as a finisher. Director of Rugby Gert Smal said that Basson will be a welcome addition to the Stormers squad this season. “Bjorn is a versatile player whose record speaks for itself, and we are excited to add another player with proven quality,” he said. Smal said that Basson’s skillset and experience is a significant boost just before the season gets under way. “In Bjorn, we have a player comfortable on the wing or at fullback who is one of the best around under the high ball,” he said. “The influence he will have on our young outside backs cannot be underestimated.” Basson said that he is excited to be joining the Stormers and is looking forward to making an impact at Newlands. “It is great for me to be here, and I cannot wait to get on to the pitch and make a difference for the team,” he said.
