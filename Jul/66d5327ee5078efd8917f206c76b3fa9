Johannesburg - The Johannesburg Central cluster crime combating unit officers have arrested two men aged 18 and 20 for dealing in drugs and dagga in Jukskei Street in Langlaagte, Gauteng police said on Saturday. Police were carrying out routine crime prevention duties on Friday afternoon when they saw a suspicious 18-year-old man, Captain Xoli Mbele said. The man fled when he saw the police vehicle, but the officers gave chase and apprehended him. They recovered a plastic bag containing dagga. The man then took the police to a place where another "huge consignment of dagga was recovered". "While still busy with their duties in the same street they arrested another 20-year-old male with different kinds of drugs." The suspects were detained at Brixton police cells and the investigation was still under way. Both men would appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Monday, Mbele said. African News Agency
