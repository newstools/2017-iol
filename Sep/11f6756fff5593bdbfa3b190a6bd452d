A new single by George Michael was heard for the first time on a UK radio station on Thursday morning. The new track, released by Sony Music, comes more than eight months after the death of the singer. The song, called Fantasy, is a remix of the track of the same name from his 1987 album Faith. The track premiered on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2 at 9am. The 53-year-old singer died on Christmas Day 2016 from heart disease and a build-up of fat in his liver, which can be linked to drug and alcohol abuse. The star had been rumoured to be working on a new single, with up to three albums of music also stored for future release. George reportedly never heard the completed version of the track before his passing. His body was found by his former partner Fadi Fawaz at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.  The Wham! singer's sisters, Melanie and Yioda, in a statement on his official website promised to share all of George's "projects" with his fans. They wrote: "Our aim is to carry on, as we know Yog would have wanted, to share and enjoy his precious legacy and to continue to bring you joy – through his extraordinarily beautiful music. David (Austin), along with Yog's loyal creative team, will continue bringing you all the projects they had been working so hard on for you, exactly as Yog would have wanted…"
