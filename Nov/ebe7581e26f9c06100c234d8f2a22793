Las Vegas - Koenigsegg wowed the world over the weekend with its 447km/h top speed run, achieved in an Agera RS, and now the Swedish hypercar manufacturer is claiming that it broke five new world records on the same day. These were all reportedly achieved on a closed road near Las Vegas in Nevada on Saturday, November 4, with with factory driver Niklas Lilja at the wheel. As far as we know the records have yet to be ratified by Guinness World Records, so for now we’ll have to take Koenigsegg's word for it. For the record, Koenigsegg used exactly the same customer-owned Agera RS that it borrowed for the 0-400-0 run last month, which is powered by a 5-litre twin-turbo V8 that produces 1014kW when run on E85 fuel. The Run was timed using a Racelogic V-Box. Here’s what was achieved last Saturday: Highest top speed for a production vehicle The Agera RS achieved a record top speed, for a production vehicle, of 446.97km/h, but this was actually an average of two runs in the opposite direction. The Agera actually hit 457.49km/h in the second run, which was mostly downhill, but the first run’s less forgiving topography saw it reach ‘just’ 436.44km/h, which brought the average down. Either way, the Koenigsegg still comfortably toppled the previous ‘acknowledged’ top speed record of 431.07km/h, achieved by the Bugatti Veyron. A new 0-400-0 record The Agera RS also beat its previous record for a zero to 400km/h to zero acceleration and braking run, completing it in 33.29 seconds versus the previous month’s time of 36.44s. Within the run, the vehicle got to 400km/h in exactly 24 seconds while the braking took 9.29 seconds over 499.3 metres. Flying kilometer on a public road Another record Koenigsegg's claiming is for the highest average speed for a flying kilometer on a public road, which was calculated to be 445.54km/h after averaging the two runs. Flying mile on a public road Ok, perhaps they’re pushing this whole record thing a bit far here, but for the record the Agera RS also recorded the world’s fastest flying ‘mile’ (equivalent of 1.6km) on a public road, with an average of 444.55km/h. Highest speed achieved on a public road Although an average of two runs was used for the ‘official’ top speed record in order to compensate for topographical variances, the downward run still technically resulted in what is thought to be the highest top speed ever recorded on a public road - 457.49km/h.
