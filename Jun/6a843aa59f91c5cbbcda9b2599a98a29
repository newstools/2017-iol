‚ÄúThe Marie Claire Naked Issue for charity is out and it has a whole entire snack‚Äù, tweeted Maps Maponyane. If you wondering why Maps is gushing over this month‚Äôs issue of Marie Claire, it's because his beau Nomzamo Mbatha is one of the celebrities who has chosen to pose nude for a good cause. Every year the publication gets their readers hot under the collar as they await to see which celeb will shed their clothes to raise funds for the charities of their choice. The shoot took place in Cape Town and Joburg in May and features Nomzamo Mbatha and other celebs on the cover. This year‚Äôs 19 celebs include chefs, TV and radio personalities, designers, models, athletes and entrepreneurs who have since been campaigning for people to go buy the magazine and support their different causes.  Maps has been rooting for Nomzamo, urging followers on social media to support her cause.The naked issue has potential to break the internet with actress and 5FM DJ Thando Thabooty also taking part in the initiative.  The Generations: The Legacy actress revealed a very steamy video of herself and some saucy snaps. Thabooty is supporting People Against Women Abuse.   #MCNaked2017 Thando Thabethe  for People Against Women Abuse .ü¶Öü¶Ö pic.twitter.com/RgxhBUUl7b  ‚Äî Thando Thabooty (@Thando_Thabethe) June 26, 2017
