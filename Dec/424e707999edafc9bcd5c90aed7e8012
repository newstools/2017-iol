Johannesburg - Remembering Robbie Malinga in true Malinga style with music and production.  Friends, family and fans gathered to celebrate the life of a music maestro at Grace Bible Church in Soweto.  Master of ceremonies Kabelo Mabalane welcomed all present to celebrate the life of Malinga.  As a Soweto born and bred musician Robbie who is from Meadowlands, Soweto started his career in the '90s, playing keyboards for bubblegum musician Freddie Gwala of Amadamara fame and the group Platform 1.     He was one of kwaito pioneers with his group Vardos from the East Rand. His solo outing Insimbi placed him in the top league of the genre. He teamed up with Doc Shebeleza to start RoboDoc in 1999 producing monster hits like Ebumnandini and Skumfete. As a producer he contributed in shaping careers of artists like Zahara, Brickz, Brown Dash, Kabelo Mabalane, Arthur Mafokate, Ntando, Nhlanhla Nciza, Izinyoka, Mzekezeke and Sbu of Amalawyer fame. He helped discover Malaika. Read more: Memorial service for #RobbieMalinga Robbie worked with Lebo M to remix Lion King to Umhlaba Wabantu for local audiences.
