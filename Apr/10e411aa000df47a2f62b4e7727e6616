TEMBISA – A workmanlike performance at the Makhulong Stadium on Friday night saw Bidvest Wits reigniting their Premiership title challenge with a 2-0 win over Highlands Park. Following a 1-0 defeat to SuperSport earlier this week, the win in Tembisa takes Gavin Hunt’s men to within two points of the new log-leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, who won 2-0 against Golden Arrows. Wits are in third position on the table with 48 points from 24 games, one behind second-placed Cape Town City with a game in hand. Wits’ victory was secured via first-half goals by Granwald Scott and Vincent Pule, while the defeat for the hosts means Gordon Igesund’s side remain in the relegation zone. In what was a tense start to the game, there were no chances on goal until Wits winger Sifiso Myeni’s 17th-minute shot went off target. The home side, though, were to take the lead shortly afterwards, Scott firing home from inside the box on 19 minutes. Mogakolodi Ngele could have made it 2-0 four minutes later, but headed straight at goalkeeper Tapuwa Kapini after a great cross from Sifiso Hlanti.  At the other end of the park, Peter Shalulile wasted an opportunity to level the game when he missed the target with only Wits keeper Moeneeb Josephs to beat. The second goal was to follow in the 38th minute when Vincent Pule rounded off a superb team move involving Eleazar Rodgers and Scott. The Lions of the North continued to battle to create openings after the restart, and instead it was Wits who had chances to increase their lead. But Rodgers’ 48th-minute header sailed over the bar, while Buhle Mkhwanazi planted his header to the right of the target midway through the second half. There was not much to trouble the visiting side’s defence in the closing minutes of the game as they closed out the victory. The result leaves the Lions of the North above Baroka FC on goal difference after claiming just two points from their last five matches.   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
