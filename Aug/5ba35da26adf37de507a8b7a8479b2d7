Actress Kajal Bagwandeen is having all the fun in Paris, France. The former 7de Laan actress posted some pictures with her pug Cleopatra and some stunning shots of Louvre, the world's largest museum. One of the shots we love is of her and her friend having a picnic with the Eiffel Tower in the background. While we love seeing her post sunset pictures and those swimwear shots on the beach, seeing her showcase the beauty of Paris is equally refreshing. The presenter and model has just wrapped up a movie called  3 Days to Go so this little holiday is definitely well deserved. Earlier this year, Bagwandeen  said that travel allowed her to experience different places and be more experimental. 
"Travelling has taught me to be a little more experimental and adventurous, to embrace different cultures whole heartedly and be in the moment," she said. 
We cannot wait to see what she posts next. Here are some of her posts: Beauty by day and night 💫 #Louvre #Paris A post shared by Kajal Bagwandeen (@kajalbagwandeen) on Aug 10, 2017 at 4:36am PDT Cleopatra in #Paris 👑 #puppylove #pugsofinstagram A post shared by Kajal Bagwandeen (@kajalbagwandeen) on Aug 10, 2017 at 1:14am PDT Happy Women's Day!
