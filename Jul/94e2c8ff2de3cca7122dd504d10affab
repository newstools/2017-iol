Justin Bieber allegedly accidentally hit a photographer with his huge pickup truck as he left his Hillsong Church group in Los Angeles on Wednesday night. The 'Sorry' hitmaker got into a fluster earlier this week when he clipped a paparazzo outside the Saban Theater, where he was attending the religious service, and knocked him to the ground as he pulled away in his black Dodge Ram truck. The incident, which took place at around 9:30pm, was captured on camera and the 23-year-old singer immediately jumped out of his vehicle to help the injured man up. Photographs, obtained by the New York Post's Page Six Column, showed the hunk talking to police as the happy-snapper clutched his leg and wriggled around in pain. Justin agreed to wait with the man until an ambulance arrived to assess his injuries and even managed to squeeze a smile out of him as he joked around with him. The 57-year-old man - whose identity is not yet known - reportedly told Justin he was "fine" but was later taken to hospital anyway with his non-life threatening injuries. According to ABC7, Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian had also attended the service at the church but were not present when the "low speed" collision took place. Meanwhile, Justin has had a tough time recently as he announced earlier this week that he had decided to cancel the remaining dates of his 'Purpose' World Tour, leaving fans across North America, Japan, Singapore, and The Philippines disappointed. He said at the time: "Everything's fine. I've been on tour for two years. I love you guys. I think you guys are awesome. Sorry for anybody who feels disappointed or betrayed, it's not my heart or anything. Have a blessed day." Justin now plans to spend some time resting and relaxing and riding his bike collection.
