The clashes resulted in a group of delegates supporting Masualle abandoning the conference. Despite their absence the electoral commission which presided over the election said the number of remaining delegates gave the conference a quorum to conduct the elections according to the ANC's constitution.

Lulama Ngcukaitobi was elected secretary with Helen Sauls-August his deputy secretary. Babalo Madikizela was elected provincial treasurer, rounding off the top five leadership positions.

Former provincial spokesman Mlibo Qoboshiyane said they were planning to appeal the outcome of the conference through internal ANC structures. However, while Qoboshiyane said there were no plans to take the matter to court, Eastern Cape lawyer Mvuzo Notyesi confirmed to some journalists that he would represent the group in a bid to challenge the conference outcome in the High Court later on Sunday.Â African News Agency
