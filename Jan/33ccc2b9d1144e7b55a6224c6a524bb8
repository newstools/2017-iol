Abuja - At least 52 people were killed and 120 wounded after a Nigerian military airstrike on a refugee camp in the country's north-east, aid organization Doctors without Borders (MSF) said Tuesday.&quot;This large-scale attack on vulnerable people who have already fled from extreme violence is shocking and unacceptable,&quot; MSF's director of operations, Jean-Clement Cabrol, said in a statement.MSF&nbsp;said its staff was trying to provide first aid and evacuate the wounded from the camp, located in Rann near the Cameroon border. Major General Lucky Irabor confirmed that a strike took place, telling reporters that &quot;dozens&quot;&nbsp;of civilians were feared dead following an air raid that targeted terrorist group Boko Haram.Irabor said two aid workers from the Red Cross and MSF and two soldiers were among those injured in the strike, adding that the military had not yet ascertained how many were killed.While saying that the military would investigate, Irabor added that &quot;it is too early for us to determine whether it was an error or not.&quot;MSF&nbsp;called on the authorities to take the necessary steps to facilitate medical evacuations by air or road for those in need of emergency care.Medical and surgical teams in Cameroon and Chad are ready to treat wounded patients, MSF added.Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram has launched offensives in Nigeria, as well as in neighbouring Chad, Niger and Cameroon. The group's goal is to enforce a strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as sharia.Since 2009, at least 14,000 people have died at the hands of the Sunni fundamentalists in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger.
