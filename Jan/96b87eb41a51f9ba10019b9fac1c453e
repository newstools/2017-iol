Cape Town Crime fighter Hanif Loonat has been fired again.The outspoken chairperson of the Mitchells Plain Community Policing Forum (CPF) Cluster was asked to step down on Wednesday night after a vote of no confidence was signed by all seven clusters under his command.A high-ranking police official present at the cluster meeting revealed that Loonat was ambushed and that it was a violation of his constitutional rights not to have allowed him to defend himself .Though the original dismissal letter was sent to Loonat on October 26, 2016, already, he apparently only stepped down this week. The official document, bearing the signatures of all the chairpersons in the cluster Mitchells Plain CPF, Athlone CPF, Lansdowne CPF, Philippi CPF, Grassy Park CPF, Lentegeur CPF and Strandfontein CPF was sent to Daily Voice by a highly placed police source.In the letter addressed to Loonat, the chairpersons ask him to step down because he was creating distance between them and the communities they serve. We would like you to exit the community police board peacefully and gracefully in order to preserve what you might consider your legacy and to maintain the dignity of all concerned, the letter states. This decision evolved around many months and after tough deliberation and thoughtful consultation. Loonat is accused of manipulating the media to promote his own agendas. It is recognised that you have developed a highly manipulative public appearance using print, broadcast and social media. It is unfortunate that the media outlets and the people who follow you do not know how incredibly opportunistic and destructive you are. And, according to them, Loonat, as a self-proclaimed police informer, has sown division within the board spreading untruths and allegedly threatening to tap their phones to expose unsubstantiated claims .He was also apparently obsessed with his failed attempt at becoming the provincial CPF chairperson, and boycotted board meetings to this effect. You perpetuated and continued with a childish tantrum after losing the vote, the letter said.Loonat was previously the provincial CPF chairperson, but was suspended in 2013 after he claimed there was rampant corruption in the police force and that gangs were outwitting police.Loonat said he will release a statement on Monday.
