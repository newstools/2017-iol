Kitzbuhel, Austria - Triple world champion Marc Marquez proved it was possible by riding his Honda RC213V MotoGP bike on one of the world’s most famous ski slopes. In this video he’s out on the snow on another, equally unlikely machine - Honda’s new X-ADV off-road maxi-scooter. No, we’re not kidding; the X-ADV is derived from the NC750 commuter machine, with its economical 745cc SOHC parallel twin (often referred to, not entirely in jest, as half a Jazz), a twin-clutch automatic transmission, scooter-style bodywork derived from that of the Integra, and dual-purpose 17 inch front and 15 inch rear tyres. Which the Honda techies replaced with studded snow tyres, and sent Marquez out to play on the famous Hahnenkamm mountain. Enjoy   IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
