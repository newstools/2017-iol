LIVERPOOL - Wayne Rooney is looking  forward to fulfilling a lifelong dream by making his European debut for Everton. The 31-year-old has won the Champions League and Europa League with Manchester United, but the visit of Slovakian side MFK Ruzomberok to Goodison Park is getting him excited. It may only be a Europa League third-round qualifier, but boyhood Evertonian Rooney, who left the club in 2004 three years before their return to continental competition, is relishing the occasion. "Something I always wanted  to do was play in Europe with Everton," said Rooney. "I was  disappointed not to do that  before but now I’ll have a chance. Obviously I won the trophy last year, so I’m hoping as a club we can go far and, you never know, try to win it. "The first game back will be an emotional day for me and I’m looking forward to it. Overall, I’m looking forward to the season, hopefully getting back playing regularly and trying to help this club move forward.” Daily Mail   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
