Manchester City maintained their irresistible Premier League charge, offering no let-up in their all-conquering season with a record 15th successive league win as they outclassed struggling Swansea City 4-0 on Wednesday. Pep Guardiola’s side, fresh from defeating their closest chasers Manchester United on Sunday, were at their dazzling best against the league’s bottom club, easing to victory with David Silva’s double and goals from Kevin de Bruyne and Sergio Aguero. Swansea, who remain rooted to the foot of the table, offered a brief illusion of being in the contest but it was over once Silva had flicked the visitors ahead superbly after 27 minutes and De Bruyne netted from a free kick in the 34th. As City eased towards a 25th Premier League match unbeaten, Silva could have had a hat trick, missing an easy chance before linking superbly with Raheem Sterling in the 52nd minute, and Aguero finished the rout five minutes from fulltime.   Leicester City secured a resounding 4-1 Premier League win at Southampton as their manager Claude Puel continued his superb start at the club and gained revenge over the team who sacked him in June. Leicester, who have won four straight Premier League games and lost only one of Puel’s eight in charge, are eighth in the table on 26 points, eight points clear of Southampton. The visitors raced into a 3-0 lead inside 38 minutes as Riyad Mahrez drilled in the opener, Shinji Okazki pounced on a loose ball to double the tally and Andy King scored at the far post to give them a commanding advantage at the break. Maya Yoshida poked the ball over the line to claw a goal back for the hosts in the second half, but Okazki scored his second with a first-time finish to ensure there was to be no comeback. Reuters
