The World's Most Beautiful Treehouse, built in Cape Town, is not exactly something you'll find on TV show Treehouse Masters, writes Marchelle Abrahams. Designed by Cape Town architects Pieter Malan and Jan-Heyn Vorster of Malan Vorster Architecture Interior Design, this treehouse could be things treehouse dreams are made of. Situated on the foothills of Cape Town's burbs, its tall, slender structure mimics the surrounding trees. And that's not all - its three four-storey cylindrical towers stand on stilts - tricking the eye into thinking the building is floating. This is no ordinary treehouse. This is style and sophistication at its best. But don't just take our word for it, watch the video and see for yourself.
