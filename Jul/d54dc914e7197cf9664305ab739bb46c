Johannesburg - The planned taxi protest against the government on Wednesday has been suspended for further engagement on the issues raised by the SA National Taxi Council (Santaco) during its meeting with government on Friday. Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi said today that the meeting on Friday agreed to address issues raised by Santaco related to taxi subsidies, taxi operating licences and access to finance by taxi operators. The first of the further engagements between the taxi industry and government will take place on Tuesday. “In taking the discussions forward, the meeting agreed to establish committees to deal with these issues. The committees will incorporate members from Santaco as well as those from the national and provincial spheres of government,” he said.
