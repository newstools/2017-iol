South African celebrity Bonang Matheba trended on Twitter this weekend after she threw herself a reportedly R500 000 30th birthday bash at Summer Place, Hyde Park on Saturday. The guest list included Fikile Mbalula, DJ Franky,  Maps Maponyane, Lorna Maseko and Basetsana Khumalo. Among the jobs the millionaire celebrity, who turned 30 on June 25, pulls off are: Top Billing presenter, face of Revlon, and ambassador for Ipanema Africa footwear, Woolworths and Courvoisier, as well as community outreach with her Bonang Bursary Fund. And now, based on pictures on social media, she can add party host extraordinaire to her CV.
