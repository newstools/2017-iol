Queen B’s book, Bonang: From A to B, has been recalled as it is riddled with factual and grammatical errors and,  according to latest viewership numbers from the Broadcast Research Council, her reality TV show Being Bonang has failed to impress, although the channel it airs on claims it’s a hit. Bonang received some online support from Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s alleged former mistress Buhle Mkhize. Mkhize told Matheba on Instagram: “We love and support you - well I do. Adjust that crown mama and continue to put our country on the map.  SHE WHO REIGNS MUTHA FUK'n SUPREME !!!🙌🏾🇿🇦❤️. We love and support you- well I DO. Adjust that crown mama and continue to put our country on the map🙌🏾. Dear 'fans' ; do NOT come for me I'll drag you to the front of the school yard. My post isn't ukuncenga anything because I do NOT do a&& kissing -unganya ubudle. This is genuine love and support for someone who makes it so beautiful being a woman and a go getter. You should just rejoice in that you've had your chance to drag and humiliate her. I know you've been waiting for years👀. You clearly don't understand public humiliation because no one knows your name. You are left free to make a million change count errors kwaShoprite and you misspell the s@#t out of everything in your cubicle but no one says anything because ASIKWAZI. Myekeni bo !. Tweet the fact that we can mention her name amongst women like Halle Berry🙌🏾🇿🇦. I dedicate RISE UP by Andra Day to you @bonang_m and every woman who's currently going through something. RISE UP IN SPITE OF ACHE. Happy Women's month QUEENS !!!. .Aaaah thank heavens I don't need slides for the gram🤣. By the way let me not forget to mention ukuthi KwaZulu we believe kukhona abantu abazalwa bembethe. Bonang is one of them so AKAYI NDAWO !!!. .  #IAmNEVERAfraidToTakeAStand #WomenSupportingWomen A post shared by @booslay_ on Aug 11, 2017 at 6:24am PDT  “This is genuine love and support for someone who makes it so beautiful being a woman and a go-getter” Bonang replied: “I wanna run to you and give you a big kiss. This means so much. Thank you. “From the deepest parts of my soul, thank you. Just what I needed... at the perfect moment. I appreciate you Queen. And thank you for this. Words fail.” Last month, Bonang debuted her first reality-television show, Being Bonang, on DStv premium’s VuzuAMP. VuzuAMP’s Nondumiso Mabece said despite the flack Being Bonang received, the show is the highest-rated show on VuzuAmp, and the channel was willing to renew it for a second season if Matheba agreed. The show failed to make the “Top 30 Programmes All Adults 15+ & DStv Adults July 2017 primetime 17h00-22h00” list. This means it ranked lower than 30th show on the list, Isithembiso-R, which has an audience of 327831, even though the media personality has millions of social media followers. The Sunday Weekend Argus reported last week that BlackBird Books took full responsibility for her book, which was riddled with grammatical and factual errors. Readers took to social media criticising her tell-all biography, exposing spelling, grammatical and factual errors. This week Exclusive Books sent out a recall of Bonang: From A to B and offered customers a full refund. Exclusive Books chief executive  Benjamin Trisk told Cape Talk: “I think Bonang’s followers deserve some respect. I can’t launch and promote this book.” The chain also cancelled all launches. It was reported on Thursday Bonang won’t apologise. Attempts to reach Bonang or her representatives were unsuccessful.
