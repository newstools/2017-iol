Munich - It’s been a long time in the making, but BMW is finally getting ready to unleash the open-top version of its futuristic, lightweight i8 hybrid sportscar. To help whet our appetites, BMW has released a teaser video showing a disguised prototype of its first ever i8 Roadster, which is expected to debut in 2018. We don’t get to see the car in all its glory, nor with the top down, but the video does show us that the Roadster has retained its tin-top sibling’s swan-wing doors. There’s also no word yet on whether the new derivative will usher in any powertrain changes. If it remains as per the coupe, then you can expect a plug-in hybrid system that mates a 1.5-litre, three-cylinder turbopetrol engine to an electric motor for system outputs of 266kW and 570Nm and an electric-only driving range of between 20km and 35km depending on how heavy your right foot is. All will be revealed next year, so stay tuned. IOL Motoring  Like us on
