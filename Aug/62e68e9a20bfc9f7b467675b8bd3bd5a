Instagram is the place where I go to satisfy my wanderlust. The images posted by travellers is enough to make you want to travel to the country to experience all its beauty. From beautiful resorts, water sports, hiking to landmarks, these posts will mesmerise you. Here are some pictures that will make you want to pack that bag and book that flight: @planetfervor Fancy taking a boat trip on the Bridge of Sighs in Venice, Italy, well we know we want to. Think turquoise water, magnificent architecture and great views, what’s not to like? @travelnoire We all feeling some “summer vibes” from Travel Noire’s post in Borobudur Jawa Tengah in Indonesia. @bestplacestogo I love winter and this picture in Switzerland is giving me serious FOMO of winter ending in South Africa. Switzerland and snow are now my two favourite S words. @aroundtheworldpix Imagine swimming in the clear waters of Merced River in California, surrounded by nature in all its glory. I cannot wait to take a dip in this gorgeous water, anyone want to join? @earthpix We all love Greece, but one of our favourite spot is Navagio Beach on the coast of Zakynthos. Clear blue skies and water is the order of the day here.
