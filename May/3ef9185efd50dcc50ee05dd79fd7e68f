Centre-back Chris Smalling and playmaker Juan Mata were both picked to start for Manchester United in Wednesday's Europa League final against Ajax at Stockholm's Friends Arena. Smalling replaced the suspended Eric Bailly and Mata came in for Jesse Lingard in two changes made by manager Jose Mourinho to the team that started the second leg of United's semi-final win over Celta Vigo. Sergio Romero kept his place in goal, while United's Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, formerly of Ajax, missed out due to a knee injury. With an average of 22 years and 282 days, the Ajax side selected by coach Peter Bosz was the youngest to ever start a major European final. Jairo Riedewald replaced suspended left-back Nick Viergever in the only change to the team that started Ajax's 3-1 loss to Lyon in the second leg of their semi-final. United are bidding to win the only major trophy they have never won, while Ajax are chasing a first continental title since the 1995 Champions League. The game will be preceded by a minute's silence in memory of the 22 victims of the terror attack in Manchester on Monday.
