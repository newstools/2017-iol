Johannesburg - Comair, which is a franchisee of British Airways and parent company of low-cost airline Kulula.com, says it will report higher interim earnings.In a statement to shareholders issued on Wednesday, the low-cost airline manager says earnings and headline earnings per share are expected to be at least 20 percent higher in the 6 months to December.In the year-ago comparative period, Comair reported pre-tax profit of R382 million, which translated into earnings per share of 18c. However, this was substantially below the 2015 figure of 37.6c, mostly due to the weak rand.In the 6 months to December 2016 headline earnings per share came in at 13.1c, compared with 37.6c in the 2015 period.Headline earnings per share are seen as a key measure of profitability as it strips out non-core items.Read also: Comair strike groundedComair, which in 2016 was involved in a strike, a tussle over its licence and a challenge from a competitor on its foreign ownership, explains that its gains are mostly due to the strengthening of the rand against the dollar.This resulted in the reversal of unrealised translation losses on the dollar-denominated aircraft loan amounting to R98 million. In addition, it said, all loss making open oil hedges had matured by December 31 and no further hedges were entered into.Oil has currently stabilised around $54 a barrel. Comair notes it cannot currently be more specific as to its figures, but will publish a more detailed statement in due course . It did not indicate when its results will be published, but JSE rules require its figures are out by the end of March.BUSINESS REPORT&nbsp;
