Durban will again be hosting the annual African Renaissance concert at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre on Saturday, May 27, at 6:30 pm.  The annual African Renaissance Festival , started in 1999 in KwaZulu-Natal, continues to play a pivotal role in enhancing the social economic agenda of the region. The Festival is a celebration of Africa’s efforts to rebuild its confidence and better its resources. May 25 is regarded as “Africa Day” : a day that recognises the growth and development of Africans, facing the challenges of a global environment. It is celebrated within the African continent to mark the formation of the Organisation of African Unity , on May 25, 1963 and the African Union in 2002. It is also intended to chart the progress made by the continent since then, to advance democracy, peace, stability and socio-economic development. This year the concert will be hosted by Radio and TV personality, Phat Joe. Musicians who will be entertaining the crowd include Afro soul singer Naima Kay, who will be sharing the stage with the two well-known South African hip hop artists, AKA and Nasty C. "I look forward to performing at the African Renaissance next week, as everybody knows I am pro-African, having collaborated with many African artists , as well as having toured many parts of Africa . I love this beautiful continent of ours” says AKA Naima Kay says she is truly honoured to have been chosen and being given this platform to perform at the African Renaissance Concert, tells her that her music has definitely grown and developed. Phat Joe thinks that events like the African Renaissance Festival are important, as they remind us of the difficult road behind us and, also, the exciting road ahead. He added by saying that he is excited to celebrate KZN’s Renaissance with his fellow Africans at this year’s Concert. IOL
