First used on a line of affordable slim-fitting jeans, jackets and shirts, Levi's Orange Tab symbolised style and youth during the counterculture of the 1960s. To embrace this past and reinterpret it for the youth of today, Levi's South Africa chose Sydney Davy and William Kuna as the fresh, local faces for the new Levi's Orange Tab Collection campaign.   Davy is a model and make-up artist living in Johannesburg, and Kuna is a DJ, producer, model and fashion design student who also hails from the city of gold. Best described as the poster couple of today, Davy and Kuna are both free pirits who believe that Living In Levi’s means: “living freely and doing it in your own way.” Both denim-lovers who use fashion as a tool to communicate who they are, their personal style reflects their own take on blending then and now. “We should never forget the past. We are a product of then, but it is up to us what we do with it and how we make it our own,” says Davy. Kuna chooses to blend retro into his personal style with jeans, vintage tees and modern monochrome pieces. “My favorite piece from the Orange Tab Collection is definitely the white trucker – I’m obsessed,” he says.   Orange Tab 2017 features vintage-inspired finishes along with updated fits and fabrics. A new addition to the bottoms range is a Vintage Kick Flare and a zip front skirt with design features such as patch pockets and additional belt loops. Men’s and women’s tees feature Levi's logos and prints pulled right from the Orange Tab Archives, while the iconic Trucker gets some Orange Tab touches in the form of Arcuate pockets and zip fronts.
