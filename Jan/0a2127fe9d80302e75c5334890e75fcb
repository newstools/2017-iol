Cape Town The people who are facing eviction from their homes in Bromwell Street, Woodstock on Tuesday said that they were not satisfied with the alternative accommodation in Wolwerivier. According to Charnell Commando, the representative for the Bromwell residents, the people have been living in their houses for generations until March 2016, when they were served with eviction notices. The tenants had lived there for two years unaware that the previous owner, Reza Syms, had sold the row to the Woodstock Hub. They had urged that Wolwerivier was too far from Woodstock where they have lived for decades and that the area was too far from schools, hospitals and their workplaces. City of Cape Town advocate, Kerrisha Pillay said the city has offered the alternative accommodation and the tenants would not accept that. She told Judge Leslie Weinkoue that the alternative accommodation were reasonable because they had the necessary household facilities. &quot;The tenants said they would have left the place if they were given an alternative accommodation, and now the city had offered them the accommodation and they simply refused it,&quot; Pillay said. Advocate Shaldon Magardie, for the residents, said that the City of Cape Town performed unreasonable actions about the situation, pointing the fact that housing is not simply bricks and water. &quot;It involves other factors, we are dealing with a location factor and not just putting people under a roof,&quot; he said. &quot;It should be a 50/50 situation because the applicants have not unlawfully invaded the residence and the Woodstock hub bought the property fully aware that there were people living in it.&quot; He added that the hub had rights to their property but the people also had rights to shelter. The matter was postponed to Wednesday. African News Agency
