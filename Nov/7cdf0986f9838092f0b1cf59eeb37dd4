I am sure those people who are reading this are having long, deep and loud conversations with themselves, questioning why any traveller will put themselves through sleeping in a ‘drain pipe’. However, as absurd as it may sound, there are travellers who are enjoying this Austrian hotel where the rooms are made from ‘repurposed, robust drain pipes.’ Das Park Hotel, located on the "Emscherinsel" in Bottrop-Ebel near Essen, Austria, offers the chance to experience a place in a totally different way.

Guests are provided with pillows, blankets and sheets. The hotel does not provide any toiletries like towels, soap and toothbrushes, so guests should bring their own. While it is a rustic setting, there are charging spots so travellers can be connected. Source: http://www.dasparkhotel.net/parkhotel/
