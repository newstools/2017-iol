Johannesburg - As 2016 drew to a close, many self-styled futurists predicted that we would see major agritech plays happen in 2017.Happily, the launch of Mastercard's digital marketplace platform, 2KUZE, is living up to those prophecies.&nbsp;Produced in collaboration with the Caf&eacute;direct Producers Foundation a non-profit organisation which works with more than 300 000 small holder farmers around the world 2KUZE connects growers with commercial agents, buyers and financial institutions in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. The app allows farmers to buy, sell and receive payments for agricultural products via their feature phones.&nbsp;If this initiative works as well as many people hope it will, it is bound to significantly improve the lives of small-scale farmers looking to produce crops more efficiently and sell them at the best possible prices.
