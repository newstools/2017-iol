London - Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to pull Britain out of the European Union s single market while staying inside parts of its customs union, saying the UK parliament will get a vote on the final Brexit deal. I can confirm today that the government will put the final deal that s agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament before it comes into force, May said in a speech to diplomats in London on Tuesday that was broadcast live in European countries including Germany. Laying out the government s Brexit plans in her most explicit description yet, May said that she was confident a deal can be reached with the European Union once the trigger to leave is invoked by the end of March. She called for a phased approach that will seek a smooth and orderly Brexit.

Staying in the single market would mean to all intents and purposes not leaving the EU at all * I do want us to have a customs agreement with the EU. I want Britain to be free to reach our own tariff schedules at the WTO * She said she wants to be able to negotiate new trade deals* She wants transitional arrangements for financial services * No more UK contributions to the EU budget The prime minister didn t say what would happen if the parliamentary vote is lost. At that point, it might be impossible to reverse the Brexit process, meaning the UK found itself outside the EU without any agreement with the bloc Bloomberg
