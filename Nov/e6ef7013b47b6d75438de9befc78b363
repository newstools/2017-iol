Washington - Furniture giant Ikea is taking advantage of Apple’s new capabilities for augmented reality - blending the digital and real worlds - and has created an app that lets you place Ikea furniture on virtually any surface at which you can point a camera. The app uses your phone’s camera to scan the floor ahead of you and measure your space, then lets you drag, drop and rotate furniture to your heart’s content. Think of it as the “chair anywhere” app. You should be able to access any furniture Ikea sells, and they are sorted by category - though a search feature would be welcome. Clearing the floor you’re trying to scan helps the app out, if you can. Ikea Place also runs best on the iPhone 6s or newer models. This app has its limits, of course. While you may have fun seeing if you actually could fit a new table in that weird corner, this is not something you’re likely to do every day. Practically speaking, this app is not that useful unless you’re decorating or dreaming of new decor. But it’s a good way to get a better sense of your own space. Free, for iOS devices.
