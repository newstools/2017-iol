 LONDON – Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fancies the idea of working with Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool as he weighs up his Arsenal future. The England forward has 12 months left on his current terms and Liverpool manager Klopp needs to reinforce his squad significantly this summer in readiness for Champions League or Europa League football next season. Arsenal are prepared to add Oxlade-Chamberlain to the bracket of their £100 000-a-week performers and talks on a new five-year deal are likely to start once the current campaign ends after the FA Cup final on May 27. Oxlade-Chamberlain, 23, is friendly with several of Liverpool’s England players and Klopp is an admirer of his versatility and application. Another issue is likely to be whether Arsenal would sell to one of their rivals. It has been mooted that he would command a fee of £30 million-plus but Liverpool’s valuation would be closer to £20 million.  Daily Mail
