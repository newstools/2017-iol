Aaron Carter is ready to date men. The 30-year-old singer came out as bisexual in the summer but just days after, he said he was only open to dating women. However, Aaron seems to have now had a change of heart and hasn't ruled out finding love with a man in the future. Speaking to the LGBTQ&A podcast, he said: "I’m just still confused about it ... about bisexuality. I definitely embrace my bisexuality and, you know, it’s still new to me. I just started talking about it, really. I have my confusions and I’m still learning about the community. Who knows what the future has to bring, whether it’s a relationship with a guy, I don’t have a problem with that. It’s something that I’ve already thought about for the album after this one. It’s already been thought through." Meanwhile, Aaron previously expressed a desire to adopt a child as it is his ultimate "goal" in life is to be a father. He said: "I was thinking about adopting. I want kids so bad. My goal is to be a father ... I turned 30 and I'm like, 'Alright, my resolution is to have a kid.' But not just a kid. A beautiful woman or man, because we can have kids too. But it has to be [with] the right person. So I'm 30 and my dad was popping out kids by the time he was 30 so I better hurry up! But I do really want to have kids. "I really want to be a dad and I want to transcend any of the shortcomings that my parents experienced growing up with us. We lost our sister Leslie, but we had a big family." Bang Showbiz
