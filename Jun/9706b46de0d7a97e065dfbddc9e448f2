Friday, 16 June is Youth Day, a historic day when South Africans pay homage to the courage and sacrifice of the Soweto youth of 1976. As we commemorate events that changed the course of our country’s future, the born-free generation are encouraged to embark on a course of their own at the Durban Green Corridor Youth Trail Run. For the fifth year in a row, the non-profit Durban Green Corridor organisation will host a fun trail run at the eNanda Adventure Park for more than 200 young people from disadvantaged communities in the surrounding area.
