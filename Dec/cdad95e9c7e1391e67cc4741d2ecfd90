SAN FRANCISCO,USA - Twitter announced an update on its two-factor authentication (2FA), the update will fully support third-party apps.  Twitter’s new login verification feature will let you use apps like Google Authenticator and Authy to verify. Before you had to use a code sent to you via text message. This is important because SMS-based 2FA, although it’s tied to an individual phone number, uses static codes.  That means that a hacker could intercept codes or any malicious third-party could access and view messages on a device.  With 2FA apps like Google Authenticator, the codes disappear in about 30 seconds, making it a more secure way to verify your identify and access your account. Note that you still need a phone number to set up 2FA on Twitter because it’s used for account recovery.  If you want to use the new feature, See Twiter's login verification support page that outline how to enable a third-party 2FA app and how to turn off text messages.    - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
