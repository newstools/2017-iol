Many people, including myself, have the belief that people should spend money on activities when travelling than spending it on a 5 star hotel. While you splurging some extra cash, there are some great benefits, here are some reasons why you should book a luxury hotel on your next trip: You feel like a VIP A 5 star hotel provides the elegance and opulence that many of us yearn for, especially for the adults who spend most of their time working hard. There is nothing better than being waited on hand and foot, and being treated like a celebrity, even if it's for a few days. Champagne or wine on arrival, state of the art confectionery and snacks are just some of the perks that comes with staying at a luxury hotel. A five star hotel also has 4 hour room service, a concierge service and housekeeping service, as well as their own on-site restaurant and bar, a gym and pool. There are great activities for the kids If you taking children on a holiday, you need a place where there are great activities. Many luxury hotels offer great benefits for children, from a Â kids club, personalised menus to spas. This leaves the adults to enjoy some quality time with each other, either by the pool or going out on tours. State of the art cuisine Luxury hotels pride themselves on good food, catering for all palettes. Get yourself and the kids all dressed up for dinner. Remember, do not skip on dessert.
