Then while the children were on the beach they witnessed a real live rescue. A swimmer was caught in a rip current and alerted the lifeguard facilitators who were on the beach with the children at the time. The three Lifesaving SA facilitators rescued the swimmer; showing the children how dangerous the ocean can be and showing them first hand how important it is to be safe around water and listen to the lifeguards. General Tire treated the children to an exciting day of spoils with each pupil receiving a Watersmart bag filled with beach essentials including a towel and peak, snacks and lunch, before being taken back to school to share their experience with their friends and family. South African’s love the water, yet more than 1,500 people die in South Africa each year from drowning, the second leading cause of accidental death after road accidents. More than half of these are children under the age of 15 years.   The Watersmart programme was rolled out in 2016 to grade four pupils as part of their life skills orientation curriculum. This started with the employment and training of facilitators to go into classrooms to present the water safety education programme. Last year, over 4 000 pupils in 20 schools in three provinces attended. This year facilitators introduced the programme to 80 schools in eight provinces reaching over 12,000 pupils.
