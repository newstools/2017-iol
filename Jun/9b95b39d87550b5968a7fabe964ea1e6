Johannesburg - Suspended SABC Chief Operations Officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng will know his fate on Monday morning following the conclusion of his disciplinary hearing last week. Motsoeneng was hauled before the hearing to answer charges of contravening the terms of his suspension after he called a media briefing in April and attacked the newly-appointed SABC interim board and the Parliamentary inquiry into the public broadcaster. A ruling last year by the Western Cape High Court had ruled Motsoeneng's appoint as COO was unlawful until he faced a disciplinary hearing which would clear his name. This was based on the Public Protectors investigation into the which it was found that he lied about his qualifications and unlawfully increased his salary substantially. Motsoeneng has continuously denied this and said the SABC board had known he had no matric when they appointed him. Politics and Development Hub
