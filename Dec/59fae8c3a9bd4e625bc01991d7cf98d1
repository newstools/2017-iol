Travellers book their holidays differently.  Some choose to book months in advance, while others tend to make spur of the moment plans. With the rise of technology, people can book their holidays whenever and wherever they want. Whether you’re researching and looking at reviews of holiday resorts in Mauritius during your morning Gautrain commute, or climbing into bed with a cup of hot chocolate and reviewing your options in your pajamas, planning holidays are getting better by the day. However, Flight Centre advises that travellers obtain the advice of a travel expert if they want peace of mind. Carlos Luis, Supplier Relationship Leader for the  Flight Centre Travel Group, says travel experts have first-hand experience of a destination and packages on offer. “They will be able to advise you as to whether your destination or package deal is in line with your holiday experience expectations. “South Africans are looking to make their rand go further, and obtaining expert face-to-face advice is an absolute must. Even though some may argue they don’t have time to go in-store and consult an expert, the good news is that certain travel retailers offer 24-hour online advice and support when making an online booking,” says Luis. 
 
He says that no one wants to be in a situation where they are faced with unforeseen, and in certain instances, nasty surprises. “Many people who book via anonymous platforms are still caught out by unforeseen costs and face disappointment when their chosen holiday package doesn’t meet their expectations. “We’ve all heard of stories where someone we know has booked directly with an airline or accommodation venue, only to be faced with sub-standard accommodation and exorbitant prices for items that they thought were included in the package,” adds Luis.
