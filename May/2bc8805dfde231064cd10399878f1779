"The ANC has not received any formal communication in this regard, we therefore won't make any comments until such time there is an engagement with Cosatu," said ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa. Addressing media following a special executive committee meeting, Cosatu general-secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said some Cosatu leaders felt that allowing Zuma to speak at Cosatu events was "inconsistent with the call for him to step down". "The meeting ultimately resolved that going forward, in respect of the workers' mandate and in line with resolution of the CEC that he step down, President Zuma will no longer be welcome to address Cosatu activities," said Ntshalintshali. The stance by the trade union federation leaders comes after Zuma was booed at Cosatu's Workers' Day celebrations in Bloemfontein in May. Zuma was unable to address the crowds and speeches were subsequently cancelled on the day. It was the first time in the history of Cosatu that an ANC president was prevented from addressing a May Day rally. Alliance partners Cosatu and the SA Communist Party (SACP) have publicly called on Zuma to resign, citing his leadership style and scandals such as Nkandla and rampant corruption, cronyism and factionalism burdening the governing party.
