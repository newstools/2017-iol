Johannesburg - Sacked South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) boss Hlaudi Motsoeneng will have to explain to the Labour Court on Wednesday, why he should not be held personally liable for the wrongful dismissal of eight journalists from the public broadcaster, while he was still in charge. On May 11, the Labour Court granted the application by trade union Solidarity, to add Motsoeneng, along with acting head of news Simon Tebele, as respondents in the trade union’s cost order case against the SABC. At the last court appearance on August 15, Motsoeneng, failed to appear. There were also no legal representative in court for Motsoeneng to explain his absence Tebele appeared alone and complained that he was not well, prompting Judge David Gush to postpone the case to September 6. The SABC has reportedly withdrawn its attorneys from representing the duo. Gush ruled that both Motsoeneng and Tebele be present when the court proceedings resume on 6 September. The case would be heard in their absence should they fail to be in court. African News Agency
