Moscow - A blast ripped through a
supermarket in Russia's St Petersburg on Wednesday evening,
injuring at least 10 shoppers, investigators said. The explosion was caused by a homemade bomb packed with
pieces of metal with a force equivalent to 200 grams of TNT,
they said. They have opened a criminal case on the grounds of
attempted murder. Nobody was killed in the explosion, and it was not
immediately clear what the motive for it was. Russian media reports said the bomb had been hidden in a
locker where shoppers leave their belongings in a branch of the
Perekrestok supermarket chain. "All possible versions of what has happened are being worked
on," Alexander Klaus, the head of St Petersburg's investigative
committee, told Reuters. "As of now, it has been established that 10 people were
taken to the city's hospitals with injuries. At the moment, the
lives of those injured are not under threat."  Reuters
