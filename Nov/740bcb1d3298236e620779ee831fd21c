BERLIN – World Cup final match-winner Mario Goetze was recalled to coach Joachim Loew’s Germany squad on Friday for friendlies against England and France. Manchester City’s Ilkay Gundiogan, also a World Cup winner from Brazil in 2014, likewise makes his return to the fold, the two having not played for Germany for almost a year. “They have recovered from their long (injury) breaks. They’re once again playing a key role for their respective clubs and have rediscovered their rhythm,” said Loew. With the likes of stalwarts Manuel Neuer, Thomas Mueller and Marco Reus missing through injury, Loew has given Leipzig’s Marcel Halstenberg a first call-up at the age of 26. Having topped their 2018 World Cup qualifying group with a perfect 10 wins from 10, Germany have a tough programme of friendlies before heading to Russia. They play England at Wembley on November 10, before hosting France in Cologne four days later. In March, they will then play Spain and Brazil.
