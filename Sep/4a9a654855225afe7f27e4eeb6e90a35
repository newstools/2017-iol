 JOHANNESBURG - The rand recovered yesterday from its weakest in a month after consumer inflation figures for August suggested interest rates will fall further, reviving economic growth. At 5pm, the rand was 0.32% firmer at  R13.264 to the dollar, reversing losses of the last week-and-a-half caused by a report showing stronger US inflation, which pushed it as low as R13.35, its softest since August 15. The rand has surrendered about 5% since September 6, tumbling through crucial technical support that saw traders mark the currency for short-selling. But the rand recovered yesterday after SA reported consumer inflation rose less than expected, to 4.8% year-on-year in August from 4.6% in July. The central bank concludes its three-day monetary policy committee meeting today. An announcement by the treasury that it had successfully issued a pair of dollar bonds in overseas capital markets worth $2.5billion (about R33.2bn) also aided the recovery. Traders said the outcome of the US Federal Reserveâ€™s policy meeting last night would also affect the rand. Meanwhile, stocks were weaker yesterday as Sasol weighed on the market after announcing a dilutive share issue. The benchmark JSE Top40 index was down 0.35% at 49575.88 points, while the broader all share index declined 0.2% to 55867.46 points. Petrochemical company Sasol dropped to a two-month low after announcing a plan to issue new shares. Shares in Sasol slumped 6.4% to R373. Gold Fields climbed 3.08% to end the session at R59.58. -REUTERS
