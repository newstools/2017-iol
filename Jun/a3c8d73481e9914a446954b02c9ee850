JAY-Z has reportedly changed his tour plans because of the arrival of his new twins. The 47-year-old rap star's wife Beyonce gave birth earlier this month and their arrival has convinced Jay to delay the tour for his much-anticipated '4:44' album, which is slated for release on June 30. A source said: "There is a tour to follow. It was originally planned for summer but has been moved to fall because of the kids."

I can't wait." The fashion designer also praised her daughter's parenting skills. She said: "[Beyoncé and JAY-Z are] incredible parents. She's a really good mom. Really patient and kind. "[My biggest lesson was] teaching them that what is on the inside counts more than what's on the outside. I see her passing it on, and it makes me really proud because that was my biggest lesson."
