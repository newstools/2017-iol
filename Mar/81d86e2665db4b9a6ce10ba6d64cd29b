Somewhere (very cold) in Sweden â€“ Hyundai is getting ready to unleash its first true hot hatchback, the i30 N, and to whet our appetites, the Korean carmaker has released a video showing works WRC driver Thierry Neuville put the new performer through its final stages of winter testing on a frozen lake. This hotted up version of the i30 will be the first Hyundai to wear the N badge, which will essentially become Hyundai's equivalent of Opel's OPC. It goes without saying then, that the company's motorsport division played a huge part in the car's development. The i30 N is set to be launched in Europe during the second half of this year, and Hyundai has yet to spill the beans on its technical specifications, however it is widely speculated that the car will be powered by a version of Hyundai's 2-litre turbopetrol engine, tuned to around 200kW. Although it will be front-wheel driven, rest assured that Hyundai has put considerable effort into sharpening the chassis. There is a limited slip differential on board too, as the video reveals. The clip also shows a six-speed manual gearbox, although that's not to say that Hyundai won't also offer a development of its seven-speed dual-clutch transmission as an option to counter VW's DSG-equipped GTI models. The car will be based around the latest i30 five-door hatchback, pictured above in standard form - so for now you'll have to use your own imagination to translate that into a more purposeful form as Hyundai will no doubt have done.
