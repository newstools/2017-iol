Johannesburg - Three of South Africa s biggest banks are considering bidding to distribute government welfare payments to more than 17 million people as a contract with a unit of Net1 UEPS Technologies comes to an end after years of legal battles. The existing contract earned Net1 about R2 billion a year, its annual reports show. Barclays Africa Group, Nedbank Group and a unit of FirstRand are contemplating bids, according to e-mailed responses to questions from the Johannesburg-based lenders. The state-owned Post Office has already said it will bid. While it is yet to issue a formal bid, the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has asked potential bidders to submit requests for information as it mulls how to distribute R139.5 billion of welfare payments a year. Ruled invalidThe current contract with Net1 unit, Cash Paymaster Services, expires at the end of March, but may be extended until Sassa s own systems are in place or an alternative provider is found, according to the Social Development Department. While CPS s contract was ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court in 2013, it continued, because Sassa did not issue a new request for proposals and there were unresolved legal disputes.

I imagine there will be a number of bidders. It s too big a contract to disregard. African Bank and Capitec Bank Holdings said they are not bidding, while Standard Bank Group said it has not engaged in the Sassa process to date.&nbsp; Bloomberg
