CAPE TOWN - Twitter has announced that a “Lite” version of its Android app is now available in 24 countries.    Since April 2017, the company has been testing the app in the Phillipines, trying to find ways to make its service more accessible to people developing countries.  It is reported that Twitter Lite will load quickly on 2G and 3G networks and also offers offline support should the internet connection drop unexpectedly. “We wanted to make Twitter Lite more discoverable, so in September we tested making it available in the Google Play Store in the Philippines,” said Jesar Shah,  Twitter product manager. 
“Through on-the-ground user research and Play Store reviews, we received a lot of valuable feedback. People using the app valued its small size, quick loading, and minimal data usage. Based on these positive results, we have decided to bring it to more people around the world,” said Shah.  
The install size of the app will only be 3MB. Twitter Lite is available right now on the Google Play Store in the following countries:  Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Malaysia, Nigeria, Nepal, Panama, Peru, Serbia, El Salvador, South Africa, Thailand, Tunisia, Tanzania, and Venezuela. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
