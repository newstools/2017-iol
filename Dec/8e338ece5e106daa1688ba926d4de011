London - The 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' star panicked when he was left caring for his young child and the dogs managed to get outside and chaos ensued. He recalled: "The wife left me home with the babies and dogs for a couple [of] hours by myself. Thank God she's back. I had it under control in the beginning, I really did, but then the baby started crying, so I went up and I grabbed the baby. "I fed the baby, changed the baby's diaper ... then out of nowhere, the dogs started barking. Came to find out my dogs got outside. Not really sure how - my big Doberman opened the damned door. I got the baby, so I call my other kids - my 12- and my 10-year-old - they don't hear me, 'cause they got the virtual-reality game set on, so they can't hear s**t I'm saying. That's when it got real." Kevin's older kids were at home but they failed to hear him because they were busy playing with their virtual reality headset. Speaking in his Instagram story, he added: "I had to put the baby down in the crib so I could go get the dogs. Soon as I put the baby down, the baby started crying. I somehow hit my foot on the rocking chair, twist my ankle. Ouch. Now I'm going outside to get the dogs, but I still got the baby stuff hooked up to the end of the chair, so I knock all that s**t over - Diaper Genie, everything. I say f**k it. S**t got real. I go grab the dogs, get the dogs inside, the baby's crying still ... gotta go grab the baby. At the same time I grab the baby, I go inside the room and knock the VR (virtual reality) set right off my damn kids' heads. They said, 'What'd we do?' I said, 'Nothing, man. Dad just had a mini breakdown. Y'all turn the volume down on that s**t so you can hear me next time I call you." Bang Showbiz
