Johannesburg - Cement producer PPC announced on Monday that it has agreed to part ways with its chief executive, Darryll Castle, and that he has subsequently decided to resign his PPC group directorships. PPC said Castle will be pursuing other interests, but will be available to ensure a smooth handover for a period of six months. Speaking on behalf of the board, PPC chairman Peter Nelson said Castle joined the board at a difficult time and was instrumental in stabilising the company and overseeing the commissioning of several new projects.
