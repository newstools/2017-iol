Durban President Jacob Zuma s intelligence-gathering unit within the ANC could be a good thing for the movement in the build-up to the critical national elections in 2019, analysts said on Monday.The ANC leader said at the weekend that when he stepped down from power, he would be part of the ANC s organising and political education committees, and establish a unit to gather intelligence on ANC branches. I m telling you I m going to create a system where we check each member, what they do outside the branch activities, said Zuma, who was the ANC s head of intelligence in exile. The system, he said, would form part of strengthening the ANC s structures ahead of the much-anticipated elections in two years time.Addressing an ANC rally at Burgersfort in Limpopo on Sunday, Zuma called on ANC members at branch level to focus on building the former liberation movement into a &shy;formidable force. Zuma wants ANC members to spy on each otherUniversity of Free State political analyst Dr Joleen Steyn-Kotze said ANC branches played a critical role in taking the party down to community level. It s not strange to find street committees aligned to the ANC, for example. On the other hand, we ve heard various allegations of branches being used for self-enrichment, she said.Zuma told throngs of ANC supporters at the weekend to represent the party in school governing bodies and street committees. If there s a death in your village, be the first to go there (to the bereaved family) and sympathise. Be active, discuss how the funeral is going to be, said Zuma. Political analyst Dumisani Hlophe said this could be interpreted as Zuma s way of encouraging people to keep active in the movement. He is saying that when his terms came to an end, he wouldl remain active, said Hlophe.He said Zuma was trying to motivate his people to be active in their movement .Daily News
