Ingredients Serves 4 4 tbsp thick-cut classic orange marmalade
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves garlic (sliced)
2 tsp dijon mustard
A few sprigs of fresh thyme or lemon thyme, plus extra for garnish
8 chicken thighs boneless with skin
1 lemon or satsuma
Black pepper
1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley (chopped) Method Preheat the oven to 180°C and prepare your side dishes. In a large bowl combine the marmalade, olive oil, garlic, mustard and thyme leaves. Score the skin of each chicken thigh a couple of times then add to the marinade and stir to coat. Leave in the fridge for half an hour if possible. Arrange the chicken pieces in a shallow ovenproof dish and pour over any remaining marinade. Slice the lemon or tangerine and tuck in and around the meat. Place the dish onto a baking tray and cover loosely with foil. Bake for 20 minutes then remove the foil and baste the chicken with the juices. Return to the oven, uncovered for 30-35 minutes (depending on size) or until the chicken is completely cooked through and the juices run clear. Season with black pepper and scatter over the chopped parsley and some extra fresh thyme. This recipe comes from Duerr’s, for more jam and marmalade recipes visit duerrs.co.uk/recipes The Independent
