Jared Ruttenberg, best known as @jaredincpt on Instagram, was 19 when he started travelling. Now with close to 30 000 followers on Instagram, the writer and social curator hopes to inspire other travellers. Jared says young people should travel to broaden their perspective. “We get so caught up in our little worlds that it’s important to see whats out there and meet different people who challenge our views," he said.  | Farewell De Hoop | So hard to say good bye to @dehoopreserve! It's been the perfect end to our #hpsaheritage road trip, hosted by @capenature and in partnership with @instagram_sa. Cape Town, I'm coming home! 🙋🏼‍♂️🇿🇦 . @capenature  #dehoopcollection #dehoopgetaway #mynature #myheritage #capenature #unescoheritage #unesco #southafricaza #meetsouthafrica #roadtrippin from #capetown to #dehoop #southafrica 📸 @richardhaubrich A post shared by Jared in Cape Town & SA 🇿🇦 (@jaredincpt) on Sep 22, 2017 at 2:26am PDT  Here are more of his travel memories: First holiday memory? Definitely jumping in the back of my parent’s double cab bakkie with my sister, and then embarking on a journey from Pietermaritzburg to Mpumalanga, making all the usual stops at God’s window, Kruger Park, Bourkes’ Luck and Sudwala caves. \ We had walkie talkies to speak to my parents for whenever we needed a toilet stop, snacks, or me being in trouble for teasing my younger sister. | Farewell Grootvadersbosch 🇿🇦 | Time to say goodbye to this magical little piece of wilderness. I'll miss the fireside chats, fynbos walks and star gazing. Thanks for having us @capenature! Off to our second spot on our UNESCO heritage tour . . Here's @richardhaubrich surveying the landscape. Been much fun planning the #hpsaheritage trips with him and @instagram_sa . . #mynature #myheritage #capenature #roadtrip from #capetown #southafrica  #instagram_sa #westerncape #localislekker #viewsfordays #africanamazing #africa A post shared by Jared in Cape Town & SA 🇿🇦 (@jaredincpt) on Sep 19, 2017 at 1:17am PDT Favourite place in SA? Wow - this is a hard one! Since I’ve just returned from a trip to the remote beaches and towering cliffs of the Wild Coast, it would have be magical stretch of coast in the Eastern Cape. Best holiday?
Spending a month in Italy last month. | Cape Town Living | I'm madly in love with Cape Town. Can you see why?🤗 These are the gorgeous views of Hout Bay from the back of Table Mountain 🏔🇿🇦 A post shared by Jared in Cape Town & SA 🇿🇦 (@jaredincpt) on Sep 12, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT What have you learnt from your travels? So much to say here – and where to start! I suppose the greatest thing for me is that travels often afford me the chance to think and reflect. Particularly when the trips allow for long periods of silence and the natural reflection that ensues. Famous mountaineer John Muir said, “I only went out for a walk and finally concluded to stay out till sundown, for going out, I found, was really going in.” Travelling outside my normal environment helps me understand what’s happening inside me. Ideal travelling companion? Someone who manages to get the balance between having to plan elements of the trip, but who is also able to deal with the spontaneous elements along the way. Beach bum, culture vulture or adrenaline junkie? I think a mix of all of them – I like to get a balanced perspective of a place and that requires have a range of experiences. Greatest travel luxury? This would be Sanbona Wildlife Reserve in the Western Cape. From the 5 star accommodation, fine dining, game drives and excellent service – a complete winner. | in another world | This has got to be the most scenic bench in the world. #tbt Milford Sound - a part of New Zealand that constantly made me feel like I was in Jurassic Park - or some other planet.

I always have my Kindle within arms length. At the moment it’s been entertaining me with Go tell a Watchmen by Harper Lee, and Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts. Where has seduced you? Clarence and Greyton – both with their seductive country charm that I find simply sublime. Worst travel experience? In Ethiopia last year my friend and I were mugged – by someone we thought was a tour guide. Very scary experience. Best hotel? The Nun Assisi, in Assisi, Italy. Underneath the hotel which is built in the remains of an ancient monastery, is the most beautiful and comprehensive spa I’ve ever visited. | in another world | This has got to be the most scenic bench in the world. #tbt Milford Sound - a part of New Zealand that constantly made me feel like I was in Jurassic Park - or some other planet.

Walk is the Hiddingh Ascension route up Table Mountain (do not try this without a guide!), and drive would be Clarence drive from Gordon’s Bay to Betty’s Bay. Best meal abroad? Beef fillet in the Amazon jungle.
