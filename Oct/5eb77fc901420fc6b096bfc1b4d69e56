National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Bakoven deputy station commander Luke van Riet said the NSRI Bakoven team was activated after 11am by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) after reports of a missing diver. “It appears that while the brothers were exiting the water after a dive in rough sea conditions, the missing man’s brother was able to get out of the surf on to rocks. "But his brother, 32, from Grassy Park, went missing and bystanders raised the alarm,” Van Riet said. At Clifton Beach on a routine training operation at the time, the rescue craft Rotarian Schipper immediately responded. An extensive search was launched involving NSRI Bakoven rescue swimmers, Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services dive unit, provincial government EMS rescue squad, Life Healthcare response paramedics, City Law Enforcement, the police and a Police Dive Unit. An EMS/AMS Skymed rescue helicopter also joined the search. “Despite the extensive sea, air and shoreline search, no sign of the man has been found. A police dive unit continues searching.” Police are assisting the family. By yesterday evening, the man had not yet been found.
