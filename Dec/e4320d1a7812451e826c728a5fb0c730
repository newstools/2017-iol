DURBAN â€“ The Absa Premiership match between AmaZulu and Bloemfontein Celtic was abandoned because of a waterlogged King Zwelithini Stadium pitch in uMlazi on Wednesday night. Match referee Jelly Chavani called the game off after 13 minutes, with the score still locked at 0-0, which must have left coaches Cavin Johnson (AmaZulu) and Veselin Jelusic (Celtic) and their players frustrated. Before the start, ground staff attempted to sweep off rain water that collected in puddles, but still the ball got stuck in patches. According to match commissioner Pius Maduna, the conditions were deemed too dangerous to play, and the Premier Soccer League (PSL) will reschedule the match. The heavy rain in KwaZulu-Natal affected another sport, with the RamSlam T20 Challenge cricket match between the Dolphins and Highveld Lions, at Kingsmead in Durban, also abandoned without a ball being bowled.
