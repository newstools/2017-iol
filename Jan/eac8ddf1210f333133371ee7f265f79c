Johannesburg The SA Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) on Wednesday threatened a &quot;total shutdown&quot; of schools in Limpopo should education authorities not heed its demand to fix the education crisis in the province. The union said it would march to the provincial education department, treasury and Premier Stanley Mathabatha's office in Polokwane on Thursday. &quot;The union will no longer tolerate the inexcusable continual explanations by the department as it tries to justify continual failures.&quot;&quot;Sadtu has resolved to take to the streets of Polokwane to pressurise the department to resolve the challenges with immediate effect, lest they face the reality of total shut-down of schools and departmental offices,&quot; the union in Limpopo said on Wednesday. The Cosatu affiliate said it demanded, among others, that textbooks and stationery be delivered to all schools, the payment of salaries and benefits owed to all teachers and principals, and the withdrawal of austerity measures by the treasury, which the union said hampered payments and the appointment of teachers. In recent years, the province has had Grade 12 exam paper leaks, a lack of school infrastructure and non-delivery of thousands of much needed textbooks to schools. Thousands of learners in Vuwani and surrounding areas were forced to abandon classes for weeks last year when violent protests against incorporation into a new municipality raged on. Schools were torched during the community protests. The union urged communities, parents and learners to join its march on Thursday. &quot;Sadtu will conduct a provincial protest march as the first warning shot, to be followed by total shut-down of schools and offices in mass rolling actions provided the issues raised are not resolved.&quot; African News Agency
