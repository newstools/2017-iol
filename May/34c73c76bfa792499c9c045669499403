BMW has officially confirmed that it will be resurrecting the 8 Series next year, and in just two weeks from now we’ll get to see a concept car that should closely resemble the production model. What you see below is BMW’s first official teaser shot of that concept car, which makes its debut at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este on 26 May. As it goes with these teaser campaigns, BMW is not telling us very much about the new 8 Series, but does promise that it’ll be a “true luxury sports coupe.” In the words of BMW Board Chairman Harald Krüger: “The BMW 8 Series Coupe will build on our tradition of luxurious sports coupes and add a genuine dream car to our line-up – a slice of pure automotive fascination. “The 8 Series Coupe will underpin our claim to leadership in the luxury segment.” According to BMW, the car embodies both “uncompromising dynamics” and “contemporary luxury”. It will undoubtedly be the most expensive car in BMW’s line-up when it hits the streets next year and will likely offer a wide range of derivatives, topped of by the obligatory M8 performance flagship. But where does this leave the 6 Series? The Coupe version has already been discontinued and rumour has it that the next-generation 6 will be more dynamically focused as its new 8 Series sibling fills the luxurious grand tourer role. The original BMW 8 Series was revealed way back in 1989 and was the second post-war German car, after the 750i, to be powered by a 12-cylinder engine, in this case a 5-litre unit that developed a potent-for-its-time 220kW and 450Nm, allowing the 1790kg 2+2-seater to dash from 0-100km/h in 6.8-seconds.
