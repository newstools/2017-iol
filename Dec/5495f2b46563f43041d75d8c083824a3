Autenzell, Germany - G-Power is well known for churning out some rather wicked BMW M car conversions, and now the Bavaria-based tuner has turned its attention to the X5 M, just in time for it to face up to Lamborghini’s 478kW Urus. G-Power offers a three-stage engine conversion culminating in a 552kW and 980Nm flagship, up from the standard version’s 423kW and 750Nm. But those who don’t want to go to those extremes can opt for a stage-one software conversion that raises outputs to 478kW and 850Nm. Here buyers can choose between a ‘plug-and-play’ power model or a software optimisation programme that can be tailored to the customer’s preferences. The second stage throws in a new set of downpipes, helping to up the ante to 514kW and 905Nm, while the aforementioned third stage (552kW) brings modified turbochargers and a G-Power titanium exhaust system with four 100mm carbon tailpipes. Buyers seeking more visual clout can opt for G-Power’s Typhoon wide-body kit, complete with widened fenders, as well as the optional carbon Venturi bonnet and 23-inch G-Power Hurricane RR forged wheels.
