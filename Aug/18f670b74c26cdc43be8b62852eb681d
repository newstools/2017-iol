Jason Momoa was treated to the best surprise of his "life" when he turned 38 earlier this month when his wife and kids turned up on the Australia-based set of his forthcoming film 'Aquaman'. The 'Game of Thrones' star was left shocked when his partner Lisa Bonet - who he married in 2007 - and their two kids Lola, 10, and Nakoa-Wolf, eight, went to see him filming the superhero movie in Queensland, Australia, as he turned 38 on August 1st. Alongside a picture of his fellow "warriors" in the motion picture, and his wife and children, he wrote on Instagram: "I have never been so surprised in my life. 38 is the greatest to date. I love u my loveee my babies my friends and OHANA to my cast and crew. Mahalo for caring. It was so beautiful. Mahalos to all the warriors It was an honor. #mindblown. (sic)" I have never been so surprised in my life.  38 is the greatest to date.  I love u my loveee my babies my friends and OHANA to my cast and crew.  Mahalo for caring.  It was so beautiful. Mahalos to all the warriors  It was an honor. #mindblown.  #roots #connected  #mytribe aloha j mahalo @jasinboland A post shared by Jason Momoa (@prideofgypsies) on Aug 3, 2017 at 7:52am PDT Filming for the motion picture began in May ahead of a December 2018 release. The movie also stars Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren, Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard, who will play Jason's on-screen love interest, the Queen of Atlantis. Screenwriter Will Beall recently insisted 'Aquaman' - which is directed by James Wan - will "blow people's minds" because it's going to have a lot of comedy as well as action. He said: "It's going to be fun, it's going to be really fun. What we've come up with and James especially - he has a really clear idea of the tone he's going to have, and I think 'Aquaman' is one that's going to blow people's minds, not just visually, but I think the story and the scope of it is really great."
