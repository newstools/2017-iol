Johannesburg - For Hannah Jane Clayton from Rustenburg Girls High School in the Western Cape, the year has been about balancing her studies with her love of music. Hannah said that instead of concentrating on only school, she sought a balance between school work and the arts, namely being in the school orchestra, heading the school s music society and being in the pupil representative council. There were a lot of events I had to organise for the music society but I just had to find a balance. I think it's important to balance school work and the other things you're interested in.&quot;On Wednesday, the youngster was lauded during a meeting with Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga who met the top 22 matriculants countrywide at Vodaworld in Midrand. Hannah said she had expected to be the best performer in her school but not in the country. The important thing was that I worked consistently throughout the year. I made sure by the time exams came, I had spoken to all my teachers about all the questions I had, Hannah said. She said on most days she arrived at school at 7am and remained there until late for her music activities. It was difficult but I think it's important to learn time-management skills during school so that you can cope after school. Hannah is one of the top performers in maths and quintile five schools. She achieved a 95percent pass in AP maths, which she wrote through the Independent Examinations Board. Hannah plans to study BSc in maths and science at either Stellenbosch University of the University of Cape Town. The Star
