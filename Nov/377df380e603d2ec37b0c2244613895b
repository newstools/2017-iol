Everton have appointed former England manager Sam Allardyce as their new manager on an 18-month contract, the English Premier League club announced Thursday. Allardyce, previously also in charge of Bolton, Newcastle, Sunderland and Crystal Palace, will take charge of the Merseysiders for the first time when they welcome Huddersfield Town for a league match at Goodison Park on Saturday. He technically replaces the fired Ronald Koeman, but Under-23 coach David Unsworth was in temporary charge until Wednesday night’s 4-0 victory over West Ham at Goodison Park. “I’ve always thought Everton was a great club,” Allardyce said in a club statement. “Obviously, the club has gone through a difficult spell, and hopefully I can put that behind us as quickly as possible and start looking upwards again. “Because, ultimately, it’s the ambition of the club, the ambition of the owner and the board, allied to the fact that it’s Everton and all the fantastic history, which have proved to be key for me.” AFP
