  St Moritz, Switzerland - The Celerina Bobsled Run, opened in 1892, is the oldest working run in the world and the only natural-ice run that’s still used for international competitions. The only reason Manx madman Mark Higgins could give for launching his 2014 Isle of Man record lap Subaru WRX STi down a twisting ice tunnel only a few centimetres wider than the car itself was that it had never been done before. The car was in 2014 rally trim, except for studded ice tyres, stiffer springs and some extra padding on the corners. Which didn’t do it much good - or Higgins for that matter. Car and driver took a beating going down the run, but both were still running afterwards. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
