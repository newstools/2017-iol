Los Angeles - By now we’re quite accustomed to car companies bombarding us with a barrage of teaser pics and videos ahead of a car’s reveal but we must admit that this one is quite unique. Being commercially tied in to the new "Spider-Man: Homecoming" movie, Audi decided to chauffeur the nimble superhero, played by Tom Holland, to the film’s world premiere in Los Angeles in its all-new, yet-to-be-revealed A8 saloon. The new limo even showed off some of its self-driving abilities during the drop-off, as an early boast about the car’s ‘Audi AI Staupilot’ gizmo that’s said to be highly automated in traffic. Yet this isn’t the first we’ve seen of the all-new A8, with previous teasers (as you’ll see in the gallery above), having shown us the headlights, taillights and basic profile of the car, while the video below gives us a quick peek at the interior, while also flaunting its remote parking feature. Talking tech, Audi has also previously confirmed that its new flagship sedan will have a fully active electromechanical suspension and dynamic four-wheel steering. Each wheel has its own electric motor and additional components include gears, a rotary tube together with internal titanium torsion bar and a lever that exerts up to 1100Nm on the suspension via a coupling rod. The suspension is adjusted in accordance with road conditions, which the car knows ahead of time thanks to low-mounted cameras that monitor the path ahead. Incredibly, if the car’s 360-degree sensors detect that a side-impact is about to occur, the suspension system can actually raise the side of the car by up to 80mm, in order to transfer the crash forces to lower, stronger parts of the car. All will be revealed on Tuesday, July 11, when the A8 makes its world debut in Barcelona. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
