FRANKFURT – Forward Anthony Ujah is returning to Mainz, from China, to bolster their attack in the second half of the season, the struggling Bundesliga club said on Wednesday. The 27-year-old Nigerian Ujah played at Mainz six years ago but did not have his breakthrough until moving on to Cologne and Werder Bremen. He returns to Mainz from Chinese club Liaoning Whowin where he played over the past 18 months. “We are happy that he has decided his future is at Mainz,” sports director Rouven Schroeder said in a club statement. Ujah said: “I am delighted to be returning to Mainz because I only have good memories from my time there. I want to help the team in the second half of the season to reach its sporting goals.” Mainz reached the German cup quarter-finals when they overcame Stuttgart on Tuesday but languish in 15th place in the league, having scored only 19 goals in 17 games.
