Rome - A man dressed in a Father Christmas costume collapsed
and died on Friday while handing out presents at a Christmas school
party in southern Italy for pupils aged around 11-13.  The Gino Rossi Vairo institute in Agropoli, a seaside town about 100
kilometres south-east of Naples, told dpa that the cause of death was
not known.  The ANSA news agency named the victim as Pasquale Pagano, 45. A local newspaper, InfoCilento.it, quoted the mother of one of the
pupils as saying that his face turned blue, suggesting that Pagano
may have had a heart attack.  "An ambulance was called and they tried everything to save his life
but there was nothing they could do for him," the mother, whose name
was not published, told the paper.  dpa
