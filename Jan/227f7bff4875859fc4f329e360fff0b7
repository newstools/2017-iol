Johannesburg - The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), which is currently involved in wage negotiations in the bus sector, says it is disgusted at the 4 percent increase offer on the table.In a statement on Monday, the union called the offer absurd and meagre . Inflation is currently 6.8 percent.Transport unions and employers in the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council (SARPBC) sat down for the first round of wage negotiations last week, with other talks set to resume in February and the last round to be held in March.Workers in the passenger bus sector are demanding a 30 percent wage increase across the board and a basic salary of R15 000 per month. They also demand a R1 500 housing allowance, R1 200 sleeping out allowance, and also want to be paid 1.5 time their normal rate when working overtime and double if forced to work on their day off.Numsa adds employers have not responded to any other demands made by it.Read also: Numsa calls for transformation in the passenger transport sectorThe union notes most workers in the sector earn R6&nbsp;000 a month before deductions. This paltry income forces workers to work excessive overtime which is a risk to both drivers and commuters. Numsa is in talks with Cobea, which represents Putco, Mgqibelo, Mayibuye, Buscor and Golden Arrow; and Sabea, which represents Megabus, Mega Express, Bojanala, Gauteng Coaches, Itereleng, Atamelang, Autopax, Great North Transport, ReaVaya, Phola Coaches and Greyhound.Numsa says, if employers do not accede to its demands by February 9, it will declare a dispute.BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE&nbsp;
