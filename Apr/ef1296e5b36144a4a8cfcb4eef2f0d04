High Wycombe, England - Hyundai's UK division has released the first teaser pic of a new compact crossover that it plans to reveal soon. The newcomer will be called the Kona and Hyundai tells us that it’ll compete in the B-segment, but that’s as much as we officially know for now. But wait. Hasn’t Hyundai just launched the Creta into that segment? Sure, in countries like India, China and SA, but not in Europe, the US or other global markets where the Kona is expected to be offered. To that end, and given that Hyundai describes it as having a “dynamic character”, you can expect the Kona to be pitched more at the sportier end of the compact crossover segment, against the likes of Nissan’s Juke and Toyota’s new CH-R. Given that it’s being aimed at Europe also means it’ll most certainly offer the company’s 1-litre turbopetrol engine, as opposed to the more traditional normally aspirated 1.6-litre unit found in the Creta, and don’t rule out the 1.6-litre turbo unit finding its way into a possible performance variant. That’s all speculation for now, but either way it won’t be long before Hyundai’s newest SUV, which is named after a district in Hawaii, shows its face to the world.
