Rhino Walking Safaris, situated on a 12 000 hectare private wilderness concession in southern Kruger National Park, is the latest tourism business to be certified by Fair Trade Tourism (FTT), providing another boost to Africa’s most responsible tourism portfolio. Offering two camps, Rhino Walking Safaris offers specialist walking safaris and authentic wilderness experiences over and above the traditional game drive safari. Plains Camp is an intimate camp of four stylishly appointed en-suite tents, with the option provided to spend a night under the stars at the popular Sleepout Decks. Sister camp Rhino Post Safari Lodge nestles into the bush along a natural seepline and offers traditional game drives as well as specialist activities, such as bird watching, walking safaris and golfing nearby. In an effort to stay true to Rhino Walking Safaris’ motto “tread gently”, the lodges were constructed in the most environmentally-friendly manner possible, utilising natural materials and minimising the use of concrete. The lodges reduce their environmental impact by generating their own power, monitoring water consumption, implementing a grey-water filtration system and recycling. Says General Manager Nikki Meyer: “Our passion for conservation means that our environmental practices are strictly implemented and sustainable. We simply wouldn’t have it any other way. While right now our Fair Trade Tourism certification sets us apart, we hope that in the near future, it will become an industry standard,” she said. Fair Trade Tourism Managing Director Jane Edge said Rhino Walking Safaris was the first safari operation to be certified in the southern Kruger Park and was a wonderful addition to the FTT portfolio. “Our many approved tour operators will welcome the opportunity of including this excellent product in Fair Trade Holiday itineraries”, she said.
