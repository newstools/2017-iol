UPDATED:  Johannesburg - President Jacob Zuma must personally be held liable for the costs of his court bid to interdict the release of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's State Capture report, the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, has ruled. Delivering a unanimous judgment on behalf of a full bench of high court judges, Judge President Dunstan Mlambo said the stance adopted by Zuma in 2016 on the status of the report was "completely unreasonable". Mlambo said there was no basis for Zuma's application to interdict the release of the report. "The president's persistence to continue with the application [for an interdict against the public protector] amounts to abuse of judicial process," said Mlambo. "He is ordered to personally pay the costs."  Zuma withdrew his application to halt the release of the report on the morning which his legal team was due to start with their arguments. The report was then released later that day. The court is due to rule later on whether Zuma is legally compelled by the Public Protector to set up the inquiry. ANA and Reuters
