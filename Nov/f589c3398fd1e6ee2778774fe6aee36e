DURBAN – Orlando Pirates have struggled to find a suitable replacement for the late Senzo Meyiwa. The big question on everyone’s lips is, “Why?” Former Orlando Pirates great Patson “Sparks” Banda, who is one of the best goal-minders to have donned the black and white of Orlando Pirates, has the answer. “The co-ordination of Orlando Pirates defence is poor. There’s no mechanism between the defenders and the goalkeeper. For me, the problem is in the goalkeeping department. Pirates need to the hire right people for the job. “I’m not saying they must hire me, but they can hire anyone. Pirates need someone who also knows the culture of the team. I can also do the job. I’m available. “The problem is that we are neglected. They know we are available and we do have qualifications,” Banda said. Asked if he has applied for the job, Banda said: “No, they know me. I don’t have to apply.” The Serbian Vukusic Ivica is currently operating as the goalkeeper coach at Pirates. Meyiwa passed away in 2014 when he was in his prime. The late Brazilian Alex Revoredo was the goalkeeper coach during the time of Meyiwa. Pirates have tried different options, but none has worked well since. They have tried the likes of Siyabonga Mpontshane, Brighton Mhlongo, Felipe Ovono, Jackson Mabokgwane and Wayne Sandilands. None of these goal-minders have been able to own the jersey. Mabokgwane was between the posts when Pirates were hammered 6-0 by Mamelodi Sundowns, while Mhlongo was the keeper when they were thumped 6-1 by SuperSport. Last season, Pirates conceded 40 goals. “Sandilands is one of those keepers you can’t rely on. He is always off his line. He needs to work on that because the opposition know he is always off his line,” Banda lamented. Sandilands has been heavily criticised after he conceded two soft goals against Mamelodi Sundowns. Pirates administrative manager Floyd Mbele declined to comment about the accusations made by Banda. @Minenhlecr7  The Star
