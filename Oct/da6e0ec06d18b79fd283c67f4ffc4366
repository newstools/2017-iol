An outstanding unbeaten century from Dane Vilas led a fine recovery from the Dolphins as they ended day one of their Sunfoil Series clash with the Cape Cobras on 310/8 at the Recreation Ground in Oudtshoorn on Monday. The right-hander was unbeaten on 145 (177 balls, 18x4, 1x6) at the close – his 14th first-class ton – having come in to bat with the visitors struggling. Proteas seamer Vernon Philander marked his return from injury with 3/24 in 17 overs to end as the best of the bowlers. But it was a day that belonged to Vilas, whose side had lost the toss and were asked to bat first. They found themselves in plenty of early trouble at 11/2 and then 100/4, with the likes of Vaughn van Jaarsveld (35), Cody Chetty (43) and Khaya Zondo (41) failing to kick on after good starts. That left Vilas to pick up the pieces, and he responded with partnerships of 49 with Sibonelo Makhanya (10) for the sixth wicket and 68 with Prenelan Subrayen (19) for the eighth wicket to give his side the slight edge. Apart from Philander’s return, Lizaad Williams (2/93) and Jason Smith (2/49) were the other main wicket-takers. Cricket South Africa
