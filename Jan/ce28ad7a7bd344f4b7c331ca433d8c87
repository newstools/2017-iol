Cape Town - An image of a woman in a cage at the back of a bakkie being circulated on social media has sparked outrage. The image was originally posted in a Facebook group called Oos-Kaap Plaaswekers Opstrand on January 17. The number plate shows that the bakkie was registered in the Eastern Cape. IOL contacted the owner of the bakkie, Leta Schoeman, who said that her husband Johan had given the woman a lift. "The lady refused to get in the front of the bakkie and then she sat at the back,” Schoeman said. She also explained why the cage is at the back. “My husband weighs sheep and the cage can come off," Schoeman said. She also said that throughout the day she and her husband had been receiving threats by people. “We're not scared, we just assisted someone." The picture sparked outrage on social media. Just saw the picture of the woman in the back of the bakkie 😭😖💔. I can't 🚶. Why do they hate us so much? — Brooke Forrester (@Ms_Msomi) January 19, 2017   @KoketsoSachane @TheGabi If a black person driving that Bakkie I would be just as outraged. She is a Human being not an animal to be caged by ANYONE  — Lee Ndaba (@LeeNdaba) January 19, 2017   Cape Argus
