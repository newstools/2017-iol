Johannesburg - The links to IOL and other Independent Media articles that were removed from Facebook on Saturday have been restored. The articles shared on the social media platform by IOL and other Independent Media title pages were marked as spam and subsequently removed by Facebook late on Saturday. This had a ripple effect - causing IOL followers who shared the articles to also receive the spam notifications. Following regular communication with Facebook, the situation has now been rectified and the links restored. We still do not have an answer from Facebook as to what caused our posts to be reported as spam, but we are in continued engagement with them to identify the cause of the problem. We apologise for any inconvenience caused and urge readers to inform us should they still receive spam alerts after sharing content.  Like us on
