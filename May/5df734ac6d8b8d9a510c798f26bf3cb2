Imagine going on a 230 km hiking adventure through the Drakensberg in KwaZulu-Natal to raise funds for the dog unit at the Kruger National Park. Well, three brave men will attempt the 230 km Drakensberg Grand Traverse, starting on 25 May, to do just that. KZN SANParks Honorary Ranger Grant Melville, mountaineer Ian Shooter and his assistant Jeffrey Mthabela will embark on the hike from Northern Drakensberg through Sani Pass to their final stop in Underberg. Depending on weather conditions, the hike will take 12-15 days. Despite the gruelling challenge, the men are looking forward to spending time in nature, taking in the remote Drakensberg mountain range. Melville said the task was to help raise funds for the canine unit in the Kruger National Park. He said the unit currently spends R1.1 million a year to keep it running. “We are hoping that everyone comes together to help raise funds for this good cause so that there can be regular dog replacements and this in turn helps reduce poaching,” he said. The men will camp up the mountains among jackals, Cape Vultures and baboons. They will make stops in certain areas to refuel and stock up. The expedition will report on their progress through video and blogs on the Climb for K9 social media platforms: Twitter: @ClimbforK9 and Instagram: ClimbforK9  clinton.moodley@inl.co.za
