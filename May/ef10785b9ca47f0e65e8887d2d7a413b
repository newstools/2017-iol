 It’s the second Collector’s Edition performance special from Jaguar Land Rover Special Vehicle Operations, and it’s called the XE SV Project 8, simply because it follows on from 2014’s F-Type Project 7. What you see here is a prototype, running its first shakedown test at the Nurburgring Nordschleife, where Jaguar maintains a workshop and test facility, so the development engineers can work on improving the chassis set-up of new models without having to go back to England after every test session. It has the hottest version yet of Jaguar Land Rover’s five-litre supercharged V8, tweaked until it squeaked and delivering in excess of 440kW. Full specifications will be released just before the Project 8 makes its first public appearance at the Goodwood Festival of Speed on 30 June. No more than 300 will then be hand-built at SVO’s technical centre in Coventry for sale worldwide, and the price, we are assured, will reflect that level of performance and exclusivity.
