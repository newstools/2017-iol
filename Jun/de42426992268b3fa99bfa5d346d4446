JOHANNESBURG – The Springboks pulled off a 35-12 victory over France on Saturday to clinch the series 3-0. Here we identify some of the key moments at Ellis Park… Fifth minute Jan Serfontein turnover five metres from the Springbok tryline, thwarting a sustained French attack and what seemed like a probable try. Seventh minute Jaco Kriel’s try came from another turnover deep in French territory as Eben Etzebeth and Jean-Luc du Preez held up Virimi Vakatawa for Franco Mostert to rip the ball loose, before Kriel crashed over for the hosts’ first five-pointer. 26th minute Another crucial Springbok turnover 10 metres from their tryline to stop France dead in their tracks, as they were building up momentum towards the line. 41st minute Eben Etzebeth’s try from a clever and well-timed lineout that saw centre Jan Serfontein jump at number two, before transferring the ball to Etzebeth, who bulldozed his way over the tryline. 62nd minute Malcolm Marx’s try came at another crucial juncture in the game as the French were trying to gain dominance in the set-piece and dictate play. The powerful hooker’s try opened up a 14-point cushion, and landed a psychological and fatal body blow to the visitors. @Vata_Ngobeni Weekend Argus   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
