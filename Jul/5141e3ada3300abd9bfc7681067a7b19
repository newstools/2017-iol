Poor weather conditions have caused a backlog in flights that are leaving OR Tambo International Airport. This after early morning fog in Kempton Park caused 24 flights to be diverted to other local, coastal and regional airports.  The airport's spokesperson, Leigh Gunkel-Keuler said conditions had improved. “The good news is that the weather improved during the morning and flights have begun to land and depart from the airport,” Gunkel-Keuler said.  However, she urged passengers to remain in touch with their airlines through the respective airline contact numbers and web sites for up to date information about delays.  “Given the earlier diversions, we will be challenged with managing flight backlogs throughout the course of the day in order to accommodate those flights which were diverted,” she said.  Gunkel-Keuler added that given this backlog, passengers scheduled to fly out of O.R. Tambo International Airport will experience considerable delays throughout the day.  “As airport management we urge all passengers to please prepare for such delays and we apologise for the inconvenience.”  This is not the first time that delays due to weather have caused issues at the airport, with the last incident reported in November 2016 due to stormy weather conditions.
