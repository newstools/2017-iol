Conceived by Block in 2013, Gymkhana GRiD is an event like no other with a mix of circuit racing, drifting and gymkhana all in one. Drivers in two separate classes for rear- and all-wheel drive cars battle each other in head-to-head format, sliding their way around a course comprising cones, barrels and other obstacles until an eventual winner gets pitted against Ken Block in a final race. Normally held at venues in Europe, this is the first time a Gymkhana GRiD round will be staged in South Africa where it will be run in conjunction with the first AutoTrader-sponsored AutoCircus event. Here petrolheads can not only peruse an exhibition of motor related products, but also check out drift trike and RC car demonstrations, watch XDL bike stunt shows or hang on tight to passenger seats in drift thrill rides. Gymkhana GRiD and AutoCircus happens at Carnival City this Saturday and Sunday. Tickets are available at www.ticketpros.co.za and priced at R415 for standing or R580 for grandstand seating. A limited amount of special VIP tickets are available for R980 per person. For more information visit the www.gymkhanagrid.com website.
