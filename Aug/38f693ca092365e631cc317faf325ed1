CPUT's Cape Town campus was shut down on Monday, following protest action which saw students and staff forced out of buildings and a fire started in an office in the multi-purpose hall. Student Representative Council chairperson Ayakha Magxotwa said the protest action was about a lack of student accommodation. 
Acting vice-chancellor Chris Nhlapo issued a statement earlier today announcing that classes had been cancelled for the day, but would resume on Tuesday. “In the interests of everyone’s safety classes and other activities on that campus have been cancelled and staff have been encouraged to work from home for today only. Normal operations will continue tomorrow,” Nhlapo said. 
Magxotwa said they shut down the university because it was the only way for their voices to be heard. 
“Today about 200 students are in need of accommodation and these are only the ones that have come forward,” he said.  
Magxotwa said they had identified buildings that would house students, which would be paid by their bursaries and students loans, however the university needed to approve these buildings before students could take occupation. 
“We want the university to fast-track the process of approving private building for student accommodation,” he added. Magxotwa said they were not behind the fire, saying he does not condone violence. CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said management and Nhlapo recently had engagements with the student leadership on the issue of student residence.
