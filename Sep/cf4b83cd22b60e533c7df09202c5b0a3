Port Eliabeth - Police in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape on Friday said they were investigating eight cases of rape after attackers allegedly used Facebook to lure their victims. On Friday, Police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, said that the attackers used various tactics to target the women, who were between 18 and 25 years old. Beetge said the incidents happened in the Motherwell and Kwazakhele areas of Port Elizabeth. "It seems like they put up a fake profile picture of someone who is desirable, maybe a businessman. On the day he wants to meet them, he has an excuse and tells the woman he will send someone else to collect her like an uncle or brother," said Beetge. Beetge said a 34-year-old man had since been arrested in connection with one of the eight rape cases. The meeting between the man and a 25-year old woman allegedly stemmed from Facebook communication. "He took her to his home in Kwazakhele where he raped her late at night,"  said Beetge. The 34-year-old man, who cannot be named as he has not pleaded, is expected back in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on September 27 for a bail application. In the latest incident, Beetge said a 27-year-old woman was allegedly raped in the bushes at NU 29, Motherwell. "She also met a guy and he said he was going to send his uncle to fetch her. "The supposed uncle, which was him, picked her up and took her to the bushes. He allegedly held her by knife point, raped her and left her in the bushes," said Beetge. No arrests have been made in the latest case. Police are investigating the possibility of the cases being linked. Beetge appealed to community members to be cautious when using social media for dating purposes. "Be very suspicious when someone says they will send another person to fetch you. It doesn't matter how intelligent he sounds, that is a clear warning sign something is wrong," Beetge said. African News Agency
