Cape Town – The under fire Allister Coetzee appears to be staying on as coach of the Springboks.  Reports suggest the national team boss will remain in charge of the side he took over from Heyneke Meyer last year, despite winning just four matches in 13 outings in 2016.  Coetzee’s position has been hotly debated in recent weeks and months, with some wanting him out, but others imploring the Saru hierarchy to give him at least another year.  Coetzee, it now seems, may stay on, but reportedly only until the June France series after which a decision on his continued involvement with the Boks will be taken. Succeed in that series and he’ll remain the head coach; fail and he’ll be asked to stand aside.  It does, however, appear that Coetzee’s coaching team will get an overhaul.  The Boks had three defence coaches in 2016, they didn’t have an attack coach and their backline coach, Mzwandile Stick, came into the international fold having not even coached at Super Rugby level.  Saru’s official stance on Coetzee and the Bok coaching set-up is expected within the next few days.  Independent Media
