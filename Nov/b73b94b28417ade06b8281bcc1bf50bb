KARACHI – Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez has been suspended from bowling in international matches after failing another assessment test, cricket’s governing body said on Thursday. The 37-year-old was reported for using suspected banned bowling actions during the third one-day international against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi last month. The International Cricket Council said subsequent testing at the United Kingdom’s Loughborough University showed a majority of spinner Hafeez’s deliveries “exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance permitted under the regulations”. “After an independent assessment, the bowling action of Hafeez is found to be illegal and, as such, the off-spinner has been suspended from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect,” the ICC said on Thursday. He will still be allowed to play domestic matches if the Pakistan Cricket Board agrees, the ICC said, adding he can apply for a reassessment once he has corrected his action. It is the third time Hafeez has been suspended for his deliveries. His action was first reported in November 2014, and after an initial suspension, he was allowed to bowl again in April 2015. But he was reported again in June 2015 and banned from bowling for a year. He resumed bowling in January this year, and played only as a batsman during the previous ban. Hafeez’s bowling adds value to his batting, having taken 136 wickets in 195 one-day internationals. He also has 52 wickets in 50 Tests and 49 in 81 Twenty20 internationals. Pakistan is the worst hit country in terms of illegal bowling actions, with ace spinner Saeed Ajmal forced to leave the game after his remodelled action left him ineffective. Not selected for the national side since 2015, Ajmal announced his retirement from all cricket on Monday. AFP
