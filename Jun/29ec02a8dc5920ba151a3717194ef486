Last night was the launch of the new Dawn in Braamfontein, Shine Studios. The #YouGotThis campaign with SAYes aims to mentor young women by helping them boost their confidence and realise their dreams. The main aim of the launch is to help women ‘see the power and beauty in them and the possibility of reaching and achieving their goals’. “I associate confidence with strength. It’s that strength that comes from inside, it’s a part of who you are,” says Yamangalisa Mbatha, Unilever brand manager. Speaking at the launch, business expert, Phuti Mahanyele encouraged women to take calculated risks and always strive to excel in their respective professions. “People who are successful are not afraid of hard work. The opportunity of learning is worth it, it pays off”, says Mahanyele. Mpho Maboi, Metro FM sportscaster and  Allegro Dinkwanyane, blogger were also part of the panel discussion, motivating women to be proud of themselves.   So blessed to be part of the #DawnEvent taking place today.
