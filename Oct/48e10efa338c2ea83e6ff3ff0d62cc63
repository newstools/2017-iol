JOHANNESBURG - Gumtree South Africa, the local online classifieds site, has revealed its short-list finalists for its best pre-owned cars in various segments. The short list of finalists was determined in partnership with Transunion, the credit bureau whose stated aim is to find innovative ways information can be used to help individuals make better and smarter decisions. Jeff Osborne, the head of automotive at Gumtree, said this week that the shortlist was a testament to the variety of affordable, quality cars in the pre-owned category. “With so many great models at affordable price points it’s no surprise that most consumers are opting for pre-owned over new. “We launched the Gumtree Pre-Owned Car Awards specifically to celebrate the cars that truly deliver value, so that South African motorists can make smart buying decisions in a tough economic climate,” he said.
Osborne said Toyota, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen had come out tops in the shortlist, with Toyota and Mercedes-Benz each boasting seven nominations across several categories and Volkswagen close behind with six. He said the shortlist would be judged by a panel of leading motoring experts based on criteria that were most relevant to the pre-owned category, including value retention and maintenance costs. The winners will be announced early next month. Osborne added that best pre-owned cars assumed even greater importance now with motorists feeling the pinch  more than ever because both petrol and diesel were expected to increase by more than 30c a litre in the first week of next month. Added pressure from the fuel price hike had many consumers seeking to reduce their monthly instalments and maintenance costs, which meant that value for money had never been a more imperative factor in the car purchase process, he said.
