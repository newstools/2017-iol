Beyonce's post about her pregnancy has become the most liked picture on Instagram. The 'Drunk in Love' hitmaker posted an announcement on the photo-sharing site that she and her husband Jay Z are expecting twins and the post has amassed over seven million likes at the time of writing. The likes on Beyonce's picture smashed the already impressive record set by Selena Gomez, who held the record with 6,315,187 likes of a picture of her drinking a can of Coca Cola. Displaying her baby bump, Beyonce captioned the record-breaking photograph: "We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. – The Carters (sic)" Since their news, celebrities have rushed to congratulate the couple, who also share Blue Ivy, five, together. Rihanna wrote: "so excited about this news!!!! Congratulations to you @Beyonce and my big brother Jay!!!! (sic)" Whilst model Hailey Baldwin quipped: "I feel like I'm more excited for Beyoncé to be pregnant than I will be for my own child." And Beyonce's close pal Chrissy Teigen shared: "But really. Congrats to my best friend Beyonce I love you so much. Hive forever. (sic)" Laverne Cox added: "Congratulations to @Beyonce and the entire Knowles Carter family (sic)" It is not known yet who will be the twins' godparents but Blue Ivy has Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's daughter Apple as her godsister. And the new arrivals will no doubt be close to Kelly Rowland's son as she previously revealed Titan and Blue "act like cousins". Kelly said: "They are extremely close. It’s the sweetest thing. It’s the greatest thing about friendship, when you’re able to grow up together and your children grow up together. They act like cousins." Bang Showbiz
