 Johannesburg – 2016 will go down as a dismal year for vehicle sales in South Africa, with Naamsa’s numbers showing an 11.4 percent drop compared to 2015, largely due to above-average vehicle price increases on the back of a weaker rand and low consumer confidence. On the upside, experts are predicting a modest upturn during the second half of this year, providing that the year doesn’t dish up any nasty economic surprises. There were no big changes to the status quo as far as South Africa’s best selling cars were concerned. The two best selling vehicles overall were bakkies, with Toyota moving 35 428 Hiluxes and Ford’s Ranger following closely at 32 468. We’ll deal with all the bakkies in a separate story, so for now let’s take a look at South Africa’s most popular conventional passenger cars and SUVs. Note, however, that brands such as Hyundai, Kia and Mercedes-Benz could not be included in this list as they do not report individual sales figures.     1. Volkswagen Polo Vivo Total sold: 28 830 Best month: Jan (2336) Worst month: Nov: (1649) Monthly average: 2402.5   2.

What to watch in 2017? Renault’s Kwid was only introduced towards the end of 2016, but it’s been selling up a storm, with 752 units sold in December alone. Expect to see it on this list next year. Many of SA’s most popular cars are also due for upgrades during the course of the year, including the Toyota Etios and Corolla, VW Golf and Renault Sandero. This could see them climb a notch or two on the sales charts. IOL Motoring   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
