"We have no doubt that his vast knowledge and passion for Africa's development and the generation of knowledge will make a unparalled contribution to UNISA's academic enterprise. Coming as it does at time when the institution has resolved to refashion its social identity as an African university shaping futures in service of humanity," ANC's spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said. Kodwa said the ANC has always been and remains committed to the development of a better Africa, at peace with itself, prosperous, integrated and firmly in charge of its own destiny. "Comrade, Thabo Mbeki, has undoubtedly been one of the most ardent advocates of such policies," said Kodwa. "We are therefore confident of his success in his new role and as we wish him well we urge many other comrades, former leaders and veterans of our movement to play a more active role contributing to the intellectual and academic success of our institutions."
