JOHANNESBURG – Nick Durandt returned to the boxing ring one last time on Friday.  And as usual, he was the centre of attention.  His coffin lay in the centre of a boxing ring at Nasrec Expo Centre as close friends and family paid tribute to the legendary boxing trainer.  Durandt died two weeks ago when his motorcycle collided with a vehicle in Clarens in the Free State last month.  Among those who paid tribute to SA’s most successful boxing trainer at his memorial was close friend and boxer Mikey Schultz, as well as Durandt’s son Damian.   Schultz said he was fortunate to have travelled the world with Durandt.  “Nick was the person that would speak his mind. He would say it the way it was, and a lot of people didn’t like that because there’s a thin line between arrogance and confidence. Nick was very confident,” said Schultz.
