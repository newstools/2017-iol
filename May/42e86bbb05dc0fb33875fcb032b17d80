ANC Provincial Secretary Deshi Ngxanga said on Saturday that Lucas missed the deadline on Friday - a lawful instruction given to her by the executive committee on Tuesday. Recent developments within the ANC in the region widen the rifts between those who support Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma or Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma at the party’s elective conference in December. Lucas is understood to be a Dlamini Zuma supporter, while the ANC provincial executive has backed Ramaphosa. On May 10, Lucas decided to reshuffle her cabinet in what was perceived to be a purging of those who were opposed to her nomination to become an ANC provincial chairperson. She axed MEC for Finance, Economic Development and Tourism Mac Jack as well as Mxolisi Sokatsha (Roads and Public Works), who was moved to Sports, Arts and Culture. At the ANC provincial elective conference held between May 11 and 14, former ANC provincial secretary Zamani Saul was elected chairperso. Saul decided that Lucas’s actions were unlawful and instructed her to rescind her reshuffle. Reacting to Lucas’s alleged insubordination, Ngxanga said: “Yes, she missed deadline. This is gross insubordination as all leaders are serving the organisation at the behest of the party. “Every leader receives a mandate from the party and is accountable to the ANC. You are obliged to abide by a lawful instruction from the ANC. Conference has issued a clear instruction on the matter.” Ngxanga said the executive committee would meet on Tuesday in Kimberley to decide on its next move. Lucas did not respond for comment. Her spokesperson, Bronwyn Thomas-Abrahams, also promised to provide a response last night, but failed to do so by the time of going to print. Political Bureau
