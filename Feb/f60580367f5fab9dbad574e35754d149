Cape Town - Trade union Solidarity has criticised Mineral Resources Minister Mosebezeni Zwane's opening
address at the mining indaba, saying it failed to boost investor
confidence. The union said
on Monday that Zwane missed an opportune moment to sway investors in order to
curb job losses in the mining sector. Zwane announced,
during his address in Cape Town on Monday, that the much anticipated Mining
Charter draft would be published in March and expected the act to be finalised
by June. However,
Solidarity has expressed concern about the various issues still plaguing the
draft, such as questions around Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment, which
the union is strongly against. "With the
charter due to be published in March 2017 and the Act being finalised in June
2017, that is according to the minister, there is still concern about the new
types of taxes contained in the first version of the charter which would place
a major financial burden on employers, ultimately resulting in lower wage
increases and more retrenchments,” said Solidarity’s General Secretary Gideon
du Plessis. Read also: #MiningINdaba: Two bills will be mining indaba's key topics Du Plessis said
it did not make sense why Zwane would say the country’s mining industry was
open for business, yet not enough was being done by the government to ensure an
investor friendly environment. “It is high time
to replace the government’s ideological impairment with reality. At the moment,
the uncertain regulatory framework filled with socialist rhetoric, especially
with regard to property rights, ownership and mineral rights, is the main
reason that jobs are destroyed while the unemployed and low-income groups that
should benefit from growth in the mining industry, together with the rest of the
country, are paying the price for a shrinking mining sector," said Du
Plessis. @ZintleMahlati  Politics and Development Hub
