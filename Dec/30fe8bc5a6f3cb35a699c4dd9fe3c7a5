Nasiriyah - Iraq hanged 38 jihadists belonging to the Islamic State group or Al-Qaeda for terrorism offences on Thursday in the southern city of Nasiriyah, provincial authorities said. It was the largest number of executions in a single day since September 25 when 42 people were put to death in the same prison. These militants were executed on terrorism charges ranging from killing members of security forces to detonating car bombs. "The prison administration executed on Thursday in the presence of Justice Minister Haidar al-Zameli, in Nasiriyah prison, 38 death row prisoners belonging to Al-Qaeda or Daesh (Isis) accused of terrorist activities," said Dakhel Kazem, a senior official in the provincial council. Amnesty International has voiced repeated concerns about the use of the death penalty in Iraq, which it ranks as one of the world's top executioners behind China, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Officials have said all the appeal options available to the condemned had been exhausted, according to the statement.Â  AFP and Reuters
