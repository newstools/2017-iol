Gunita Singh, Director at Dentem, an orthodontic clinic, and Tanvir Singh, senior orthodontist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, have listed out precautions to keep your teeth healthy: * Change your toothbrush, replace it often with a new one as it can help maintain oral hygiene. * Regular flossing is recommended. The suggested floss length is 18 inches per flossing session. With a day-by-day flossing plan, that means approximately 45 feet of floss a month. Stock up to abstain from running out. * Proper healthy diet enriched with Vitamin C and calcium along with seasonal foods and vegetables is essential. The nutritionally beneficial fruits and vegetables in monsoon are apples, pears, strawberries, curd and oats. * Regular dental check-ups are a must for every individual. It not only keeps your teeth in a healthy state but will also indicate any early stage problem. * During this season, we also tend to enjoy hot beverages like coffee and tea, which contain caffeine that leads to dental decay and staining. Try to have less of both. - IANS
