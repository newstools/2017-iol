You have probably heard about the opening of Radisson Blu Hotel & Residence in Cape Town last month. It has been billed as the highest residential building in the Mother City and has won several awards for its architectural design. The hotel is situated on the corner of Riebeeck and Long Street in Cape Town’s foreshore. The Radisson Blu Hotel & Residence’s design is a beautiful mix of historic and ultra-modern. The 214-room hotel residence is within walking distance of all the city’s main tourist attractions and just a kilometer away from the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC).  Desmond O'Connor, General Manager of the Radisson Blu Hotel & Residence Cape Town, said the iconic design of the building pays homage to the Art Deco design language and inspiration was drawn from the natural elements of the city. Here are some photographs of the hotel:
