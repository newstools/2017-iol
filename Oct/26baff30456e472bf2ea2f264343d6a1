Some events are worth the throwback, and one that definitely stands out is the search for this year’s Eastgate Look of Fashion queen that took place last week at the Eastgate mall. The glam carpet  for this prestigious pageant was rolled for the crowning of this year’s winner, 21 year old Bryoni Govender, who was crowned along side Mishka Kramer and Michelle Moolman. To kick start the day, celebrated singer Lira took to the stage to serenade the populated mall walkway, including the many mall shoppers who just stopped to enjoy this high quality of the entire contest. The final 12 were put to task on various including strutting the runway and answering questions on different topics, like normal pageant do. They were judged on their answers, and all the parading done throughout the morning. And what would a pageant be without the evening wear section? The 12 ladies sashayed on stage in gorgeous gowns, while The Voice SA’s Josh Ansley serenaded the crowds. Not only was this a pageant but also a fashion event, showing casing beautiful garments from their sponsored labels. Our hearts definitely melted a group of young models paraded clothes and proving that South Africa’s future of modelling is in safe hands. The competition gives the winner a foot in the door of their careers. Bryoni will be fast tracked into the Miss South Africa 2018 pageant's semi-finalist round, where she will then have to fight for her spot into the finale. The mid-morning do also included other performances from The Voice’s Freddy Lalendle, among the dancing that took place on the day. Also present on the day was Bokang Montjane who was, a couple of years ago, also a contestant as all the 12 finalists and went on to win the widely acclaimed miss SA pageant in 2010. Bridget Msinga and  Mampho Brescia also showed face. The judge panel also included media personalities Sashi Naidoo, Poppy Ntshongwana and Actress Jay Anstey just to name a few.
