DURBAN – Former Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana marksman Bongani “Drogba” Ndulula will have to continue with his search for a new club after he was rejected by National First Division side Royal Eagles. Ndulula, who currently holds the record for the most number of goals scored in the Under-23 national team, was on trials at the KwaZulu-Natal outfit. Eagles general manager James Dlamini confirmed that Ndulula will be not signed. “Ndulula has been with us for quite some time now. We are not signing him. He is not up to standard with other players. It will take time before he can play, so that’s why we are not signing him,” Dlamini explained. Ndulula made five appearances for Bafana and scored two goals. He was the part of the team that represented the country in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Equatorial Guinea in 2015. Ndulula last appeared for Chippa United back in January after being booted by the Amakhosi. Good news for the Aliwal North-born striker is that he is a free agent, which means the transfer window period won’t affect him. Eagles are set to sign former Orlando Pirates striker Siyanda Ngubo instead of Ndulula. The former Under-20 youth international has been on loan at Eagles for the past two seasons. His contract came to an end in June and it was not renewed. “We are talking to Siyanda. We are keen on retaining him. As soon as we agree, we will sign,” Dlamini elaborated. @minenhlecr7  IOL Sport  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
