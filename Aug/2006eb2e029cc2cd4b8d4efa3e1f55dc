Santa Shoebox Project's new March to a Million campaign is about to open for pledging and you can help the country’s best-loved children’s charity achieve its ultimate goal - to reach one million under-privileged children by 2019. SSB’s Founder and CEO, Irené Pieters says the organisation is excited at the prospect of reaching one million children in the next three years. According to Pieters, since the launch of the project in 2006, it has benefitted 652 180 socially-vulnerable children. To reach the one million mark, the goal for each year has increased to 110 000 Shoeboxes this year, 115 000 in 2018 and 125 000 in 2019. For those with hectic schedules who are unable to shop for Santa Shoebox goodies, or those who live far from Drop Off points, SSB offers the Virtual Santa Shoebox. This option allows donors to visit the SSB website to pledge for a child by name, to select their box contents online and to write a personal message to the child. The SSB team will then pack these decorated boxes and deliver them to children around the country. A Virtual Santa Shoebox costs R400. “Our mission is far from impossible; imagine the monumental difference we’ll make in the lives of children throughout the country when we reach our goal. South Africa, we can’t do it without you - we need your help!” Pieters says. * Visit https://santashoebox.org.za/ for more info
