Russian princess, Olga Romanoff, spent a week at Karkloof Safari Villas in KwaZulu-Natal.  This was her first visit to South Africa. Clinton Moodley chatted to her about her travels. It is your first time in South Africa. How does it feel? I absolutely love the country. I have roots in South Africa, so it was always on the bucket list to visit. What is the best place you have ever visited? Believe it or not, South Africa is one of my favourites, and I cannot wait to visit the rest of the country. My older son, Nicolas, visited Cape Town for his honeymoon and he loved it. I will definitely be back. I also love Saint Petersburg in Russia, Italy and Belgium. And the worst….? I try to make the best of each situation. Must have travel items to take on a trip?  My cellphone, electric toothbrush, sunscreen, moisturiser and clothes to suit the climate of that particular destination. Your ideal travel companion? My daughter, Alex. Travel advice for our readers? Try to research as much as possible before you visit so you can plan better. Where to next? Japan in February. I am looking forward to seeing the plan and finding out more about its culture.
