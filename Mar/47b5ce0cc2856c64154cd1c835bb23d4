Old Mutual, which says regulatory change has made its business too complex to run in its current form, is aiming to break into four parts by the end of next year. It has said it plans to dual-list its UK asset management and African emerging markets businesses in London and Joburg, and reduce stakes in US firm Old Mutual Asset Management (Omam) and Nedbank. It had already started cutting its stake in Omam.

HNA has been building up stakes in a series of companies across Europe and the US. It is now the third biggest shareholder in Deutsche Bank, raising its stake last week to 4.76 percent. The two-stage Omam deal involves the sale to HNA of a 10 percent tranche at $15.30 per share and 15 percent tranche at $15.75 per share, at about $1 premium to Friday’s closing price. Reuters
