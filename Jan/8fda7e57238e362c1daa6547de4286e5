South Africa s share price, the rand exchange rate, is expected to continue its journey to recovery. On January 21, 2016, the rand reached a low of R16.86 against the dollar. Since then, against all odds, the rand has improved by more than 342 cents, or 20.8 percent. The main reasons: downgrading avoided; improved exports; lower current account deficit; inflow of portfolio capital; improved prospects for economic growth and a credible budget. This is nothing else than a vote of confidence in the ability of the South African economy to honour commitments towards the stabilisation of economic, fiscal and monetary policy.

The platform for a stronger economy and a stronger rand exchange rate is therefore set. Global captains of industry, presidents of countries and chief executives of multibillion family-owned businesses (I was privileged to meet them with Dr Iqbal Surv&eacute;, the chairman of the Sekunjalo Group) were highly impressed with the overall positive messages Dr Surv&eacute; presented at Davos last week.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, ministers Jeff Radebe, Pravin Gordhan and Rob Davies, as well as Dr Surv&eacute; and many other industry executives, conveyed a strong message: South Africa is open for business. An interview with Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago dealt with the role of the Reserve Bank to protect the value of the exchange rate . I would like to salute the Reserve Bank Governor for his ambassadorial contribution during WEF 2017. BUSINESS REPORT
