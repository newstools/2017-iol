The South African super couple was clearly spoiled by the French Champagne brand, with them attending a fancy pre-party before the festivities on Saturday. Nomzamo Mbatha spoke to IOL Entertainment about her experience. "Thirty of Veuve's most valued people from around the world and I was one of them. The president of Veuve Clicquot Jean-Marc was also in attendance, as well as the rest of the executive team who absolutely LOVE South Africa and the offering we bring to the brand. I had the pleasure of meeting host Neil Patrick Harris and the lady of the hour, Alicia Keys who was going to perform later that afternoon.The ambiance was beautiful! New Yorkers have an interesting style and flair. Extremely relaxed. There was 7000 people in total. Huge!The day was beautiful and so incredible. I couldn't stop taking about South Africa and how beautiful our country is, inviting everyone over!"  See all the glamorous pics below:   Exactly what life feels like.
