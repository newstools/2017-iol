Ingolstadt, Germany – OK, Audi fans, it’s time to go into CSI mode and examine the evidence – in this case a new teaser video for the 2018 A8. We already know about the A8’s new digital instrument cluster, but the video also reveals glimpses of distinctive, very upmarket, wood-veneer-and-leather interior trim; the traditional, slightly understated A8 cabin decor may well be a thing of the past. From the exterior shots we can deduce a narrow, full-width LED tail-light strip and a big chunky grille that looks like it was lifted straight off the Prologue concept like a hand-me-down sweater. But of course, the video is actually about the fact that the new A8 can do its own valet parking, cued from the key fob, neatly illustrated by the lights in the house going on just as the car’s lights go off. The new A8 will be officially revealed on 11 July at the first-ever Audi Summit in Barcelona. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
