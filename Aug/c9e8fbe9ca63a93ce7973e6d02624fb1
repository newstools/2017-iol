Kim Kardashian West fears Taylor Swift will take aim at her on her new single. The 36-year-old beauty and her husband Kanye West fell out with Taylor over the lyrics in the rapper's 'Famous' track last year, in which he referred to the singer as a "b***h*", and Kim now fears a backlash could be on the horizon. A source said: "One of the few people out there that is not very excited for Taylor Swift's upcoming music is Kim Kardashian. "She feels that she will be attacked along with Kanye in a future song over their past differences and she doesn't want to deal with the
fallout of a Taylor Swift song and what that does to people." Taylor has teased her new single by posting a picture of a snake on her Twitter account, prompting fans to speculate the record will be a diss track.    The claims come shortly after Kanye's former mentor Jay-Z blasted the rap star, saying he crossed a line when he spoke badly of his wife
