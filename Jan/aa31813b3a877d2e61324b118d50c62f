Cape Town- Police say an alleged drug pusher has been caught red-handed with heroin in her vagina. The 34-year-old woman was nabbed with 17 units of the drug shoved up her private parts.  Members of the Philippi Police Station, headed by station commander Colonel Dennis Ables, carried out an operation at 6am in Surdown Walk, Hanover Park, on Friday. Cops entered a house in the street and found three people inside. Ables said that they immediately identified the woman as a known drug peddler. Police sources believe the woman is a drug runner for an Americans gang boss. “She is a known drug pusher, but this is the first time that she has been arrested,” said Ables. Drug pushers often hide their wares inside their body cavities such as the vagina, anus, mouth, ears, and nostrils, and even the hair. Ables said two female police officers took the woman to a room, where she gave her consent for them to search her vagina. “You do get some women who will not give consent if they think they will be caught. This was the first time that this woman was caught with the drugs,” added Ables. He said cops found 17 units of heroin wrapped in three layers of plastic, with an estimated street value of R850. Ables said cops made two more arrests at the house for drug possession, and confiscated heroin, dagga and Mandrax worth a total of R1500. “Philippi police were carrying out an operation where illegal drug and liquor outlets were searched randomly,” said Ables. A 30-year-old man was arrested for possession of Mandrax after the drugs were allegedly found inside his jeans pocket. And a 24-year-old man was also arrested for possession of dagga. The trio is expected to make an appearance at the Athlone Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges of possession of drugs. Daily Voice
