Residents of informal settlement Dakota in Isipingo held a march to create awareness around the abuse of women and children in the area on Wednesday. The local government clinic in the area in co-operation with Project Empower hosted a high tea where women were educated on issues affecting women, ranging from cancers that women are susceptible to, physical and emotional abuse and the link between gender-based violence and HIV/AIDS.
