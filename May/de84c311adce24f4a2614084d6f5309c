Yoga classes vary from hot yoga to power and relaxation yoga, depending on fitness level. To find out more about yoga and how it can change your lifestyle, we joined in a trendy new Yoga Studio, myUtopia at the V&A Waterfront, and spoke to co-founder and chief executive  Sandi Dekker.  What are the health benefits of yoga? Body Yoga brings physical strength, protects from injury and detoxifies the organs. Regular practice increases  energy and flexibility. Mind Yoga boosts mental strength. It helps relationships and relieves stress. Spirit Everything is connected so when body and mind are aligned, inner peace follows. When the spirit is centred, there is greater awareness and intuition. Does yoga beat the gym, if so why? Often we run or cycle and don’t stretch properly. Yoga will help this. It can be done on its own or to complement other forms of exercise. What is the inspiration behind your studio name, MyUTOPIA? I want a happy place where my clients find inner peace and strength. What makes MyUTOPIA different or special? It’s a five-star experience.  We supply organic mats, premier toiletries and a Blow Bar service for quick hair blowing. What is the inspiration for the interior at the studio? I wanted all the feng shui elements. The designer in me also wanted a studio that is clean, spacious and elegant. What are the services available at myUTOPIA? myUTOPIA offers yoga, Pilates, foam-rolling and barre classes. We have a small in-house deli and café called Nourish for health food and drinks..
