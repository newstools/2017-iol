It pays to take a walk through the streets of Franschhoek to build an appetite and once we’d done that, we settled on Sacred Ground. Seeing as it was a Sunday, the decision was easy - they serve a traditional Sunday roast with a complimentary glass of house wine (and seeing as it’s Franschhoek, the house wine is nothing to be sniffed at) and a delicious dessert for just R140. The roast consisted of cauliflower and broccoli bake with cheese sauce, crispy roast potatoes and a few good slices of tender, juicy, roast leg of Karoo lamb served with a decadent gravy and scratch-made mint sauce. The meat was tender, the potatoes tasted like mom made them and the gravy was so delicious you’d want to drink it. The meal was finished with the most incredible chilli chocolate torte I have eaten. If you’re keen to cleanse your pallet, you can’t go wrong with Sacred Ground’s home-made sorbets, ice creams and smoothies. You might be tempted to shop from the deli too, even though you’ve just eaten. You know, for the ride home. Cape Argus
