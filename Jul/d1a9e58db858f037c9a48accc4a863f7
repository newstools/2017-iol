 An online encyclopaedia of music where customers can listen to songs and then find out about what influences them, has helped propel sales at Bloomsbury. The Harry Potter publisher has branched into music with the launch of the service which links customers to songs. The Bloomsbury Popular Music library was released earlier this year, aimed at students, academics and researchers with a catalogue of information on music genres and artists. Artists such as Bruce Springsteen (pictured) were popular with students who wanted to find out what had helped inspire his hit songs. Bloomsburyâ€™s digital resources arm was up 16pc in the three months to May. Total sales, including books, surged 19pc. And Harry Potter books, continued to fly off the shelves, even as it celebrated its 20th anniversary in June. Daily Mail
