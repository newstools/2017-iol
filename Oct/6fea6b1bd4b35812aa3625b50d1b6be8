Paris, France - Created as one of the competitor cars in the latest PlayStation4 Gran Turismo Sport video game, this is Peugeot’s L750 R HYbrid Vision Gran Turismo virtual concept. It’s an evolution of the 2016 L500 R HYbrid Vision, says the maker, showcasing Peugeot’s new design language and, of course, with more performance. It has a petrol engine rated for 427kW at 10 000rpm, and a 125kW electric motor for a total of 552kW. Thanks to a carbon-fibre structure and forged magnesium wheels, the L750 R weighs only 825kg - 175kg lighter than its predecessor - giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 669kW per ton and a 0-100 sprint time of just 2.4 seconds. Independent front and rear suspensions vary the ride height according to the car’s speed, while the four ventilated carbon-ceramic discs are modulated by a new dual-circuit hydraulic braking system.  You can drive either the L500 R or the L750 R in-game in Grand Turismo Sport, and watch or compete in a 24-hour endurance race on Twitter.  IOL Motoring
