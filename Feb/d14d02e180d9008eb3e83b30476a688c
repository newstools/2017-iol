Johannesburg - A beastly performance car like the BMW M6 needs to be treated with respect, and a whole lot of driving skill to go with that, but in the wrong hands things can go awfully pear shaped as the driver in this video so aptly demonstrates. The video of a CCTV recording at a security complex in Johannesburg was posted on Facebook on Monday and shows a maroon BMW M6 driver losing composure around a sharp bend, almost taking out a silver VW Polo Vivo in the process, but as the other camera recording shows, a certain wall was not so lucky.
