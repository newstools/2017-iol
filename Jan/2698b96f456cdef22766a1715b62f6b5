Cape Town The Claremont Main Road Mosque in Cape Town has strongly condemned the killing of six worshippers at the Grand Mosque in Qu&eacute;bec, Canada, and other acts aimed at Muslim communities, saying this was emblematic of the rise of right-wing extremism in parts of the Western world. In a statement on Monday night, the Mosque condemned the attack in Qu&eacute;bec on Sunday evening, which also left several other worshippers injured, as well as an earlier incident in Texas in the US which saw the Islamic Center of Victoria burnt to the ground by unknown attackers. &quot;It is not a coincidence that these hate crimes come in the wake of US President Donald Trump's recent executive orders that effectively ban citizens (whether refugees or not) from seven Muslim majority countries from entering the United States, at least for the next 90 days,&quot; the leadership of the Mosque said. &quot;They also subject Muslims with valid US visas or permanent residence status, to extreme vetting before being allowed into the US. The executive orders of Trump are emblematic of the blatant racist and right-wing extremism, which is slowly becoming mainstream in the US and parts of Europe.&quot; It added that Trump's rhetoric and policies violated the dignity and freedom of movement of people, especially those from Muslim-majority countries. &quot;More worrying is that the implementation of these anti-Muslim and racist policies will not only embolden the hate mongering of Islamophobes as we have already seen, but will also do little to mitigate the fomenting of Muslim extremism globally. The Islamophobic profiling of Muslims feeds into the simplistic Muslim extremist narrative of groups such as ISIS, who claim the West is intent on destroying Islam and so Muslims must fight back to preserve their dignity and faith.&quot; The leadership called on peace and justice-loving people in North America and all over the world to continue to raise their voices against hate and prejudice and to use this lamentable moment in world history as a turning point to build a more compassionate and just world order.
