DURBAN - For party girl Zodwa Wabantu, 2017 has been a year of headlines. It was her July dress, being kicked out of Zimbabwe because her dance moves were too explicit, and the nude moment in the pool at her Mozambique hotel. We spoke to the controversial dance queen about her plans for Christmas. She met the Independent on Saturday in Durban’s Florida Road wearing a sexy gold dress.When the queen of the skimpy outfit was asked why she had chosen to wear such a long dress, she broke out into a fit of laughter. “I wanted to look especially decent for your readers, its Christmas after all,” she said. Zodwa, famous for her sultry dance moves, will be working throughout the Christmas weekend and will only get a break after the first week of January. On Christmas Day she is booked to perform in Mpumalanga. When asked what meal she would’ve liked to prepare for Christmas lunch, she broke into a loud laugh. "I don’t care for fancy meals, especially on Christmas day, I drink and generally have a good time, I just don’t cook,” she said.

Zodwa, who has a 12-year-old son, says she has done all her Christmas shopping and has made sure that her son will enjoy the day with friends and family, at her apartment in Durban. “It’s important that my son is well taken care of. He’s my number one priority,” she said. Then she gave us a few dance lessons, with ‘Vosho’ her signature dance being the first on the list. “I’ve had a fairly good year, I’m hoping for an even better year in 2018!” the dancer said. In fact she’s already thinking ahead to 2018. In a tweet this week she was already wishing her fans happy new year. THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
