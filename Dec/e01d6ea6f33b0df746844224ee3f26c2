Johannesburg - The Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, delivered another scathing judgment when it dismissed President Jacob Zuma's application to review former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's State Capture report. In his judgment, Mlambo said the stance adopted by Zuma in 2016 on the status of the report was "completely unreasonable". Mlambo said there was no basis for Zuma's application to interdict the release of the report.

"He is ordered to personally pay the costs."  IOL and ANA Read more: #StateCapture: Court rules Zuma must pay
