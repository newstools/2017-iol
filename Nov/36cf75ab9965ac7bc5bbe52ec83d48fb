JOHANNESBURG – Cape Town City and their coach Benni McCarthy are in hot water with the Premier Soccer League (PSL). The coach and club have been ordered to appear before the PSL Disciplinary Committee next week Tuesday, November 21. The charge relates to McCarthy’s post-match comments directed at match official Phillip Tinyani at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium after the club’s fixture against Chippa United on October 22. In a post-match press conference, McCarthy expressed his frustration with Tiyani when, asked about the referee's performance in the 2-1 defeat, the former Bafana striker reportedly said: “Don’t ask me about that cow.” Meanwhile, Bidvest Wits and their official Jonathan Schloss will face the Disciplinary Committee to answer misconduct charges pursuant to the fixture between Bidvest Wits and Kaizer Chiefs, which took place on September 16. Schloss and Wits will appear in front of the DC on Tuesday evening. Also on Tuesday evening, Platinum Stars will face a charge of contravening the Compliance Manual for failing to submit their provisional squad list ahead of their fixture against Maritzburg United on October 27 at Harry Gwala Stadium.
