DORTMUND, Germany - Sven Bender is leaving Borussia Dortmund for Bayer Leverkusen where he will be reunited with his twin brother and fellow German international Lars Bender. Both clubs confirmed the transfer on Thursday, with Leverkusen saying the defender is to sign a four-year contract until 2021 after the mandatory medical. The transfer fee has been estimated at 15 million euros (17.2 million dollars). Bender, 28, spent eight years in Dortmund, has six Germany caps and won a silver medal at last year's Olympics. "The Leverkusen inquiry was very tempting after eight wonderful years in Dortmund. I know the club's strength from many matches against them. And I know how good Lars feels here," Sven Bender said in a Leverkusen statement. New Leverkusen coach Heiko Herrlich said: "His mentality and team spirit make him an ideal leader on and off the pitch ... It is fantastic to have both Benders in the team." The brothers played together in the second division at 1860 Munich until 2009 when Sven joined Dortmund and Lars went to Leverkusen where is now is team captain.
