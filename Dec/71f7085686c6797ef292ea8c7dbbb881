CAPE TOWN - As festive season holidays begin Cape Town small businesses should be prepared for expensive and limited water, Sage said on Wednesday. According to the city’s water dashboard, as of Tuesday, only 37% of residents were using less than 87 litres per person per day, as required. The vice president for new customer acquisition at Sage Africa & Middle East, Verish Harduth notes that the small businesses' profits could be harmed by the charges and penalties of using more water than required under water restrictions. Harduth shares a few steps that small businesses can adopt to contribute towards sustainable water use in the country, while optimising their business operations:   This speaks to the specifics of water needed for business operations. Define how much you need for catering and staff use, production, watering gardens and so on. Then look at ways to reduce usage.   Install an aerator or flow restrictor on taps, and water-efficient urinals to use less water.  Do away with automatic flushing urinals.

Put water saving tips near kitchen and bathroom taps to remind team members of the importance of saving water.
