Gigi Lamayne is officially off the market.  The 22-year-old hip hop star took to social media this morning to share the exciting news of her engagement. But who is this politician she is referring to? She tweeted a snap of her hand bearing what looks like an engagement ring and wrote: Man of my dreams ✅ Perfect Ring ✅ #Lobola #YesIm22 #MyFavouritePolitician Earlier today, a love-stricken Lamayne shared another snap with the caption: I don't deserve you. #Lobola. The last image on the collage sparked a lot of speculation: fans seem more curious about who Lamayne is engaged to than the possibility that someone actually proposed. Someone even suggested the politician she referred to might be Jeff Radebe.    I don't deserve you.  #Lobola ❤❤ pic.twitter.com/qzkFmfURRZ  — #OnMe (@Gigi_Lamayne) June 8, 2017  Mr. Politician. ❤ pic.twitter.com/9mtLsEvxIj — #OnMe (@Gigi_Lamayne) June 8, 2017  why Gigi Why I Just Wanted To Be You're Ugly BF 😢😥 pic.twitter.com/O9vY4H85pO — Mr.Adams (@RealGiftAdams) June 8, 2017  well..congratulations u deserve it — Xolieh Zee® (@zibanyoni_elcy) June 8, 2017
