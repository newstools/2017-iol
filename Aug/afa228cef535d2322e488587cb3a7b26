GWM’s Haval isn’t the only Chinese vehicle brand with grand ambitions to shift upmarket. Chery recently revealed that the company is taking its global expansion to the next level with a new European-focused model line-up that will be announced at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September. This product salvo will kick off with an all-new compact SUV, which the company is previewing with the design sketches you see here. Sure, they’re just drawings and the finished product could be somewhat less exciting, but the new design direction certainly seems promising so far. Although the new products will still wear a Chery badge, the carmaker says the newcomers will be sophisticated enough to take on the world’s most “mature” markets. In Chery’s own words, the upcoming compact SUV will feature: “state-of-the-art connectivity and electrified powertrain technology as standard.” The new design language that’s being teased here, and which Chery refers to as ‘Life in Motion’ was developed by the company’s new Chief Designer James Hope. In addition to “hydrodynamic surfacing” inspired by running water, there is also a new corporate face featuring a chromed horisontal bar that stretches across the vehicle's front end. Chery is also planning to set up design and R&D in Europe to coinicide with its launch onto the European market in the coming years. IOL Motoring
