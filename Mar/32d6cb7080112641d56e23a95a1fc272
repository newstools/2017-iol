The 31-year-old glamour model, who previously dated Hugh Hefner and lived with the 90-year-old in the Playboy mansion, has found it “hard” living with the title. The blonde beauty shared a lengthy message about her reputation on social media with a picture of her sporting a skimpy bikini. She captioned the Instagram post: “Sometimes it's hard always being labelled a Playboy girl cuz I've never ever seen myself that way. I left the playboy world almost 10 years ago *  have moved on in my life. Comparing me now to that 18-year-old girl then is apples *  oranges (sic).” She continued: “I can give a f*** about meeting standards and impressing people. Who I am is who I am *  the people who follow my journey know what's up *  I love you guys.” And Kendra - who has two-year-old daughter Alijah and seven-year-old son Hank with her husband Hank Baskett - has teased she has “a lot” of new ventures coming up, which she is eager to reveal to her fans. She added: “Got a lot coming up *  can't wait to share it with all of you.” Although Kendra has revealed she is uncomfortable with her association to Playboy, she is glad she gained “a best friend” in Hefner from her experience with Playboy. Speaking previously, she said: “You know what my favourite part of living there was? Hef. At first, it wasn't. I moved into the Playboy Mansion at 18 years old. I went in for the party, but I left with a best friend.” BANG SHOWBIZ
