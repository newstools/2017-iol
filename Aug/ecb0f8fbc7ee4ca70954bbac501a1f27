While Ford’s GT supercar is already dripping with heritage, this new limited edition is a very specific tribute to the GT40’s Le Mans-winning history. Sporting red and white stripe livery, the Ford GT ‘67 Heritage edition celebrates the 40th anniversary of Dan Gurney and AJ Foyt’s Le Mans victory in the GT40 mark IV race car. In addition to the unique exterior paint job, complete with ‘1’ logos, the edition is set apart by silver mirror caps and 20-inch silver satin alloys.
Stepping inside, the few lucky owners who get to buy this unique GT will be greeted by a serialised identification plate, exposed matte carbon door sills as well as a new upholstery with red stitching for the seats and steering wheel, and matching red seatbelts. No mechanical modifications have been made to this special GT, and with good reason. The mid-engined supercar is already the very definition of potency, with its twin-turbo 3.5-litre V6 rated at 482kW and 746Nm. A dry weight of just 1400kg, thanks to the GT’s lightweight carbon fibre and aluninium architecture, ensures a truly explosive power to weight ratio. And yet it’s not just the fastest Ford ever, the GT’s active suspension and aerodynamic systems make it incredibly agile too. Ford says that the production car shares “a great deal” with the GT race car that won the GT class at Le Mans last year, at least a lot more than just racing stripes. IOL Motoring
