JOHANNESBURG – Thando Roto (Tuks Athletics) showed on Saturday that he has what it takes to become a member of South Africa’s elite sub-10 second sprint club when he won the 100 metres in a time of 9.98 at a league meeting at the University of Johannesburg on Saturday. Roto has become the fifth South African sprinter to dip under 10 seconds. The others are Akani Simbine (9.89), Henricho Bruintjies (9.97), Wayde van Niekerk (9.98) and Simon Magakwe (9.98). Unfortunately for Roto, the wind from behind was far too strong (+3.0) for his time to be officially recognised. Officially, his best time is still 10.27. Roto is not too worried that his first sub-10 effort was not recognised. “It was still amazing to finish a race and see that I have managed to dip under 10 seconds. I now know that on any good day, I will be able to do so again,” said the Tuk Athletics athlete. Roto made it clear that he will never allow himself to become obsessed with running sub-10 seconds. “Naturally I want to run a sub-10, but I am not one to make predictions as to when and where it is going to happen. I will let my legs do the talking. If you are prepared to put in the hard work, you will eventually reap success.” His next race will be to the Varsity Athletics meet in Potchefstroom. Hennie Kriel, who coaches Roto, predicted earlier in the week that Roto is ready to run a sub-10 second race. However, he did not expect it to happen on Saturday as Roto had a slight niggle. Sprinting is Roto’s passion. Often in his free time, he would go to Kriel’s house to study video clips of sprinting greats in action. “I like to watch what the former sprinters did, and then compare it to what we are doing now. You learn a lot doing so.” African News Agency
