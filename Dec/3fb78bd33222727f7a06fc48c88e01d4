It’s the holidays and for most of us that means lots of eating followed by weight gain and a New Year’s resolution to lose weight. But why not take a healthier approach to what we eat during the holidays and beyond? According to a recent website survey, about 18 percent of people say it’s hard for them to eat healthily because they don’t want to stop eating their favourite foods. The good news is you don’t have to, you can still enjoy your treats, but in moderation. It’s all about being mindful of what you eat. Another good idea is to make healthy alternatives to your favourite food.
