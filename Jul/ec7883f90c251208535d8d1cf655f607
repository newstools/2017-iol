The BMW 4 Series, sexy cousin of the 3 Series sedan, has undergone a nip and tuck along with a suspension upgrade to bring it up to date for 2017. The mid-life freshening applies to the complete 4 Series range, namely the two-door Coupe, four-door Gran Coupe and two-door Convertible, which collectively have sold over 5 500 units in South Africa since 2013. The styling's been sharpened with a subtle facelift including restyled LED headlights that take the place of the previous xenon units, along with new LED rear lights, while all models get LED front foglamps as standard. Modified air intakes, line-specific applications and a new rear apron add further styling touches. Cabins are freshened-up across the range with new electroplated detailing, chrome applications and centre console in high-gloss black for a more exclusive, high-quality feel. The instrument panel gets double stitching, while three new upholstery colours and a trio of new interior trim strips increase the number of interior personalisation options. Also introduced are two new exterior paint finishes: Snapper Rocks Blue and Sunset Orange, and there is also one new model-specific wheel design each for the Sport Line, Luxury Line and M Sport equipment grades. The optional Navigation system Professional for the new BMW 4 Series now features an interface with large, easier-to-use tile-style control pads. The range can be optionally fitted with the Multifunctional Instrument Display, giving the driver the choice of different visualisation options for all displays depending on the driving experience mode selected. The 4 Series Coupe and Gran Coupe now come with a stiffer suspension set-up for sportier handling but reportedly without any loss of ride comfort. This applies to the standard, M Sport and Adaptive suspension choices. The tweak also improves straight-line stability and imparts more communicative steering. High-performance tyres are available as a factory-fitted option for all models from the BMW 430i upwards. The engine line up is unchanged, and the 4 Series Coupe and Gran Coupe are as before available in three turbopetrol versions (420i, 430i, 440i) with outputs respectively pegged at 135kW, 185kW and 240kW, and one turbodiesel (420d) rated for 140kW. The 4 Series Convertible is only offered in the petrol engine derivatives, and as previously a 317kW M4 is available as the range-topper in the Coupe and Convertible (but not the Gran Coupe). Transmission choices also stay the same with a six-speed manual or eight-speed Streptronic auto (440i is offered in auto only), and six-speed manual or seven-speed M Double Clutch for the M4 derivatives.
