Ricci-Lee Kalish , a 25 year old travel and lifestyle blogger behind Big Bad Wolf and actress, favourite place is Hong Kong. We speak to her to find out more. Where do you stay? Hong Kong, like so many travel destinations is packed to the brim with some of the best hotels in the world. I have stayed in so many different hotels, but I have come to realise that the destination of the hotel is more important than the hotel itself. On my last trip I stayed at the beautiful Pottinger Hotel on Hong Kong Island in the middle of the bustling Lan Kwai Fong district. I am certainly going back there. What do you buy? Everything and anything, especially shoes. Best walk around the city? Through Lan Kwai Fong onto Soho into one of the many bars and restaurants. Or perhaps Victoria Peak to get a glimpse into the life of the wealthy few. Any must visit spots? Island Beverly for the best shopping experience in the world. Lily and Bloom for delicious food and a beautiful atmosphere. Burger circus for the best burgers in Hong Kong. Also, Bibo, the world's most unique fine-dining restaurant set up in the middle of an art gallery. It is something special to experience. What is your favourite view? The best view is in Victoria Peak. The greenery juxtaposed with the bustling city is breathtaking. Even the view out of your 15-story-hotel-room is exceptional. What do you do on a free afternoon? Hit the crazy streets of Causeway Bay. Best place for cocktails? The Woods, plus the atmosphere of Hollywood road just adds to the experience.
