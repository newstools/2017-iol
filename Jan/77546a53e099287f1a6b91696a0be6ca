"ER24 along with several other services, arrived on the scene and found both the taxi and truck parked in the middle of the road," ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. He said that the taxi was found to have sustained a large amount of damage in the collision. "Upon closer inspection, paramedics discovered several bodies lying in the wrecked taxi. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the patients and they were declared on the scene." Meiring said that a number of the bodies were laying trapped inside of the vehicle. Paramedics on the scene assessed the patients and found that approximately 14 had sustained injuries ranging from minor to serious. "The patients were treated for their injuries and thereafter transported to various hospitals in the area for further treatment. Local authorities were on the scene to close off the road as well as to begin their investigation," Meiring said African News Agency
