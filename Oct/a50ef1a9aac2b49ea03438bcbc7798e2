Johannesburg - Social media was abuzz on Thursday in the wake of Human Settlements Minister and African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Lindiwe Sisulu's comments during a radio interview. Sisulu was being interviewed by 702 host Eusebius McKaiser and touched on a range of issues, including the rape saga involving President Jacob Zuma. In September 2006, Zuma stood trial for the alleged rape of Khwezi but he was found not guilty and acquitted. Khwezi died last October, after a long struggle with HIV/Aids. Radio host Redi Tlhabi has since penned a book titled: Khwezi: The Remarkable Story of Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo, detailing Khwezi's life story.

"Yes, I believe Khwezi... I understood the outcome of this unfortunate debacle to have been one where perhaps there was a misunderstanding of intent. "I believe she believes she was raped." Pressed further on whether she personally believed Khwezi's version of events, Sisulu went on to say she did not have enough evidence to make a decision on the matter. Sisulu was also asked about the rape allegations Jennifer Ferguson levelled against a well-known soccer boss, ducking the question and instead saying the focus should not be so much whether society believes the victim but rather that the perception towards women abuse changes. Other issues the presidential hopeful touched on was Zuma's presidency and the state of the ANC today. Sisulu's interview caused waves on social media, with users expressing confusion and anger over the comments she made regarding Khwezi's rape claims.
