Johannesburg Fleet management company Cartrack has reached more than 600&nbsp;000 active subscribers globally, it says.The company said on Tuesday that this represents an increase of 20 percent since last February.Cartrack is in competition with Inseego, which provides the Ctrack brand and has about the same number of subscribers. Ctrack became part of Inseego after the company, previously called Novatel, changed its name after buying out South African group DigiCore in a R1 billion deal a few years ago.Cartrack says an increase in active subscribers translates into further growth in annuity revenues, and is a key determinant in the ability of the company to grow its base globally.Cartrack notes the growth exceeds its expectations, and it has now established a US operation, which will now start trading. The introduction of mandatory Electronic Driver Logging legislation for long haul vehicles in the US is creating substantial growth opportunities for fleet management technology.

The robust subscriber growth was driven by strong performances in Asia, Europe and South Africa. The South African market is differentiated by the stolen vehicle recovery service that is provided, a sector in which Cartrack has performed consistently well. Cartrack has managed to maintain an exceptional recovery rate of around 94 percent over many years. It explains this is partly as a result of having an in-house recovery team, which allows greater control of deployment and service levels.BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
