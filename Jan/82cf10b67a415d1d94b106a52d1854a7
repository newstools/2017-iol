Cape Town Residents in three streets in Rocklands were left without water on Thursday after water meters were stolen and drains damaged.According to the Rocklands Community Neighbourhood Watch, residents in Phantom, Maryland and Sea Otter roads, were without water for most of the day as the main water supply was turned off during repairs. Valarie Moses, 66, the watch s controller, said they were alerted to the situation between 4am and 6am. I got a call from a member of the community watch who was on patrol. He told me that three homes in Phantom Road were affected.&quot; I put the call through to say urgent attention water meters stolen at those addresses . Moses phoned the Cape Town Water Department to report the matter. On Thursday the department was still working on the problem. I was called again at 6:30am that there were more water meters stolen at six houses Sea Otter Road and one house in Maryland Road. When Moses arrived at the scene almost all the drain covers were damaged and water was really running away, it was unnecessary .She said thieves often sold the metal for scrap. It has to do with copper theft. A member of the Sea Block View Watch, Clarence Trouncell, said a resident told him it sounded as if it was raining. Some thought it was raining... the water was running away. He said it was a major setback for families in the affected area. Children must go to school and people must go to work, now there s no water. The Cape Town Department of Water was investigating the matter. matthew.vanschalkwyk@inl.co.za Cape Argus
