In alarming news for those who like to relax with a glass of wine in the evening, any type of tipple raises the likelihood of developing two non-melanoma forms of the disease. Chemicals released when the body breaks down alcohol are believed to be responsible. The large-scale study defined a standard drink as 10g of alcohol - roughly equivalent to a small glass of wine or half a beer. Every daily 10g shot increased the risk of one type - cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas - by 11% and the other - basal cell carcinoma - rose by 7%. These are tumours that arise in the outer layers of the skin, but in different cell types. They are usually easily treatable. Dermatologist Dr Eunyoung Cho, of Brown University, Rhode Island, said: "This is an important finding given there are few ways to prevent skin cancer. "Given the high prevalence of skin cancer and alcohol drinking, modifying alcohol behaviour may be a realistic goal that can help substantially reduce the global non-melanoma skin cancer burden." Last year, the same team found a daily glass of white wine increased the risk of 
melanoma, the third and deadliest type of the skin cancer, 
by 13%. This is because 
ethanol in alcohol can metabolise into acetaldehyde, a compound that damages DNA. The study, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, pooled data from 13 previous studies that followed participants for up to 30 years, comparing alcohol use with 95Â 241 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer. Skin cancer is the most common form in the UK. - Daily Mail
