Cape Town Public Service and Administration Minister Ngoako Ramathlodi on Friday issued a second stern reminder to public servants to comply with the Public Service Code of Conduct after a furore broke out over a Facebook post by the spokesperson for his Cabinet colleague Bathabile Dlamini. In a statement, his department said he condemned the conduct of all public servants for &quot;who conduct themselves in an unprofessional manner&quot;. &quot;Minister Ramatlhodi emphatically states that all Public Servants without exception must at all the times comply with the Public Service Code of Conduct and provisions of the Service Charter.&quot; He warned that those who breach the code would be dealt with in terms of the Public Service Act and urged accounting officers in government departments to enforce compliance with this law. The minister recalled that the code of conduct enjoined all public servants to use the state's property including laptops and cell phones and other resources, honestly, efficiently and only for official purposes. &quot;Therefore, the minister states categorically that State resources such as laptops, telephones, cellphones and even data which are meant to execute official duties cannot be utilised to undermine and contravene the letter and spirit of the Code of Conduct without any consequences,&quot; his office said. &quot;This abuse of State resources is not only unethical behaviour but also a misconduct ... Minister Ramatlhodi is unwavering in his warning that this behaviour will not be tolerated in the Public Service and the necessary disciplinary steps will be instituted to curb such a conduct.&quot; Dlamini's spokesperson Lumka Oliphant this week took to Facebook with an expletive-laden post to defend the minister against suggestions that she was drunk while delivering a speech in Germiston.
