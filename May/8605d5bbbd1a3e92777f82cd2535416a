The Proteas are on yet another mission to capture an elusive piece of ICC silverware. It is the Champions Trophy they are hunting this time, on the familiar shires of the United Kingdom. Prior to departure this week, Proteas legend Hashim Amla launched a state-of-the-art PitchVision simulator at The Hashim Amla Academy and Foundation, situated in Westwood Mall in Westville, Durban. Amla also found time in his hectic schedule to speak to Independent Media about his relationship with “Quinny” de Kock – who claimed five titles at the Cricket South Africa awards – his desire to improve his record at major ICC tournaments, and his recent Indian Premier League successes. Amla hit two hundreds for the Kings XI Punjab to prove that he is equally adept at playing T20 cricket as he is in the Test and one-day international formats. * Read the full Q&A interview with Hashim Amla in the Saturday Star, Independent on Saturday, Pretoria News Weekend and the Weekend Argus newspapers tomorrow. * Here is a video of the launch of the simulator at Amla’s academy.
