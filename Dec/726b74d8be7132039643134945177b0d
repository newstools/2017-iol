CAPE TOWN - Parliament's Eskom inquiry into state capture has for the first time received some comment from the controversial Gupta family.  The committee on Wednesday received a two-page document from Ajay Gupta's lawyer.  In the letter, Gupta asked the committee to be given a chance to respond to allegations raised by the committee on state capture.  Gupta also said that he had proof that the testimony of suspended Eskom head of legal Suzanne Daniels was incorrect and was, in fact, lies.  The documents by Ajay Gupta said that he was not in the country when Daniels supposedly said she had a meeting with him in Johannesburg.  Daniels claimed that she met with Deputy Minister of Public Enterprises Ben Martins, Ajay Gupta, Salim Essa and Duduzane Zuma in a flat near Melrose Arch in July 2017. The main aim of the meeting was to discuss the court case of former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe. Gupta states that he was in India at the time and can provide a video of himself at a religious ceremony that has been uploaded to YouTube.   After the statement was read, a number of ministers took issue with the document. They said it was another form of intimidation and they would not stand for it.  The committee has, however, welcomed the move by Ajay Gupta and agrees that he should come forward and testify before the committee.  The members took issue with a request from Gupta, he asked for the list of questions the committee wishes to ask him.  ACDP member Steve Swart said that no individual had been given the questions beforehand and Gupta would not be given preferential treatment.  Read Also: #EskomInquiry: Subpoena given to Deputy Minister Ben Martins -BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
