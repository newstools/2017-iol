Seven-time champion Roger Federer reached the Wimbledon third round for the 15th time on Thursday with a 7-6 (7/0), 6-3, 6-2 win over Dusan Lajovic of Serbia. Third seeded Federer will face Germany's Mischa Zverev for a place in the last-16. "I struggled at the start and couldn't find my rhythm," said Federer who dropped his first service game to trail 2-0 to his 79th-ranked opponent. "But once I got rid of the nerves I played some inspired stuff after that." Zverev defeated world number one Andy Murray at the Australian Open this year, but Federer has won both his meetings against the left-handed serve-and-volleyer this year, including on grass at Halle last month.
