Between work, your family, your home and everything else that you need to attend to, sometimes you forget to take care of yourself, and taking care of yourself needs to be a top priority. Spending just a few hours putting yourself first is important and treating yourself to a day at the spa is the perfect downtime. There is a new spot in town that is just perfect for 'me time'. Chan Wela, a new spa situated in Century City, Cape Town, recently opened its doors. The who’s who of Cape Town were given a sneak peek of this sanctuary that takes ‘me time’ to a whole new level, in an exclusive and intimate pre-launch party. Emceed by make-up artist and social butterfly Lindy Lin, the event introduced social media darlings like Nadia Jaftha, Nabeelah Staggie, Angelique Fredericks and Thabiet Amardien - along with members of the press - to a spa unlike any other in Cape Town. With Chan Wela meaning ‘me time’ in Thai, guests got to experience this first-hand as they were treated to pampering pedicures while sipping on bubbly or mocktails that come standard with all appointments. They were also given the opportunity spoil themselves with spot prizes that were up for grabs. The evening saw guests mingling and meeting Chan Wela’s team of trained spa therapists, along with owner, Kirby Shearon, who shared that she decided to start her own spa - where the customer is queen and each appointment is celebrated - after enduring too many bad experiences at other salons. “When you step into the salon, you can expect to be taken care of while you enjoy a much-needed break.”  From massages to manicures, waxing to eyelash extensions, you’ll find all you need and more at Chan Wela.
