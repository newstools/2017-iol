The two men &quot;dishonestly agreed to procure or make submissions of rates by Barclays&quot; to create an advantage to the trading positions of the bank s employees, prosecutors said in the indictment.&quot;There was no subterfuge, there was no effort in some way of concealing or deceiving,&quot; Ryder said. He was &quot;totally open at all stages,&quot; and no one at Barclays -- from his bosses to compliance -- &quot;ever said a word about it.&quot;The Libor dollar rate was determined by a panel of 16 banks asked in a daily poll to estimate how much it would cost them to borrow from each other for different periods. The rate is tied to a variety of financial products, including loans and mortgages.Contogoulas and Reich have pleaded not guilty. Bloomberg
