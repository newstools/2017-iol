“On Tuesday, Mr Maimane’s office got in touch with us and informed us that he will be travelling to Zambia on Thursday. When we contacted Lusaka, especially about the details of Mr Maimane’s visit, we were advised that Mr Maimane should reschedule his visit,” Mwamba said as he addressed journalists in Pretoria. “His visit was to go and visit his colleague [Hakainde Hichilema leader of largest Zambian opposition United Party for National Development UPNP] in solidarity and we found nothing wrong with that. But we advised him that there were concerns over his statements and utterances especially regarding the sanctity of our courts.” Mwamba said Maimane had also been advised to get permission from Zambian courts “because there is a list which the courts approve, of people who can see Mr Hichilema.”. The envoy said Lusaka will determine who is allowed permission into the country. “Zambia as a sovereign state can determine persons to be allowed entry into our country and that is not in dispute. We however wish to affirm that Zambia continues to have mutual and admirable diplomatic relations with South Africa based on the historical economic and social ties between the two countries,” said Mwamba. Maimane on Friday described how he and his colleagues were manhandled, had their cellphones and iPads confiscated by Zambian authorities. They were prevented from disembarking from the aeroplane in Lusaka before they were forced to leave that country. Maimane and his entourage were in Lusaka, hoping to attend the treason trial of Hichilema. The detained opposition leader is alleged to have attempted to block Zambian President Edgar Lungu’s motorcade, which was travelling on the same road. African News Agency
