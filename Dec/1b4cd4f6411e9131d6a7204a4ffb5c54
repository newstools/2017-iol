Cairo - Yemen's Houthi rebels have fired a ballistic rocket targeting the al-Yamamah royal palace in the Saudi capital Riyadh, Houthi-affiliated TV al-Masirah reported on Tuesday, with Saudi media later reporting that the missile had been intercepted. The Saudi-led coalition said it intercepted the missile south of the capital Riyadh, according to the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya broadcaster. Last month, Saudi Arabia intercepted two ballistic missiles fired from Yemen: One of them was near King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh while the other targeted the south-western Saudi province of Assir. In response, the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis imposed a blockade on Yemen, saying it aimed at stopping the flow of Iranian arms to the Shiite Houthis. The blockade was gradually lifted afterwards. This is a developing story.  dpa
