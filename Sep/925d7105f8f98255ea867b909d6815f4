We were lucky enough to make this on a tropical beach in Mozambique, but’s it’s just as lekker when made for mates on the braai in my back garden. We used king mackerel, but any oily fish, like yellow tail, will do the trick! You’ll Need: 1 x 500g deboned fillet of king mackerel with the skin left on
2 handfuls cashew nuts
100ml olive oil 
piri piri sauce (blood hot chilli sauce)
4 ultra ripe tomatoes
2 stale bruschetta
8 cloves garlic – peeled
handful of salad leaves – including peppery rocket
1 lemon cut into wedges
sea salt to taste Method 
Make a paste by crushing the cashew nuts with a drizzle of olive oil and a splash of piri piri sauce – think of the consistency of peanut butter. Rub the whole fish fillet with olive oil and place skin-side down on a chopping board. Use your hands to smear the paste all over the flesh side. Chuck the tomatoes on the braai to roast and sweeten. Place the whole fillet, skin-side down, on a grid and cook until the skin goes crisp and brown. Cut the bruschetta in half and toast on the fire until really crispy then rub the garlic and pap tomatoes onto the toasty bread so that it can be absorbed.
Lay down a layer of salad leaves on the bruschetta, place sliced rounds of the fish on top and add more leaves, drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil. Eat immediately!
