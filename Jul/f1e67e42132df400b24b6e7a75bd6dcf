CAPE TOWN - Fullback SP Marais and flank Rynhardt Elstadt return for the Stormers' Super Rugby quarter-final against the Chiefs at Newlands on Saturday. The experienced duo return from injury in the only two changes to the Stormers' starting line-up for the playoff match, which kicks off at 5pm on Saturday. In the only change to the backline, Marais returns from a knee injury and starts at fullback, with Dillyn Leyds moving to the wing and Seabelo Senatla set to provide impact off the replacements bench. Elstadt was a late withdrawal last week due to a wrist injury, but is fit to take his place on the side of the scrum for the quarter-final, with Sikhumbuzo Notshe among the replacements. There are just two other changes to the match-day squad, with fit-again props Oli Kebble and Wilco Louw both included on the replacements bench. Stormers coach Robbie Fleck said that his team is looking forward to playing in front of the Newlands Faithful. "The players and management have put in a lot of hard work and in preparation for this game. "It was a cracker of a game when we played the Chiefs at Newlands earlier in the season, and we are looking forward to another one," he said. * Season tickets are valid for the Super Rugby quarter-final at Newlands on Saturday.
