Johannesburg The Botshabelo Magistrate's Court on Wednesday, convicted and sentenced a mother of three to 18-years imprisonment for culpable homicide, Free State police said. Police spokesperson Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said Puleng Paulinah Gwadi, 33, was sentenced to 18 years of which six years were suspended to five years. Mpakane said, Gwadi was arrested in July 2015, and charged with culpable homicide. &quot;The sentence follows the incident that happened in November 2010, where [an] inquest case was initially investigated. It was later revealed that Gwadi left her three kids aged 10 months, four and eight-years-old inside her shack at V-Section in Botshabelo and went to the night vigil at the nearby street,&quot; Mpakane said. &quot;She only came back the next morning and found her shack burned down. After [a] long investigation it was discovered that Gwadi separated with her husband the same year, and she told her friends she [wants] revenge.&quot; Mpakane said the case was investigated by officers who left no stone unturned to ensure that justice was served for two girls and a boy after their mother left a burning candle in the shack knowing her intentions.
