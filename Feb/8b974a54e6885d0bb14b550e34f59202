Cape Town – The National Treasury wants the speedy prosecution of people involved in suspicious transactions in their bank accounts.  Deputy Director-General in the Treasury Ismail Momoniat told Parliament on Wednesday the process of prosecution was slow.  He said institutions must be able to share information, and prosecutors act speedily in such cases.  The Treasury was briefing the standing committee on finance during discussions on the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill.  The Financial Intelligence Centre told the committee there were more that 200 000 suspicious accounts they handle every year.  However, it was not clear how many such cases ended up in the courts.  But Momoniat said he believed there were very few people who were prosecuted.  When South Africa goes to the Financial Action Task Force, an international body dealing with money laundering and financing terrorism, some countries indicate they act swiftly on these suspicious accounts.  “In this entire system there is so much to be done so that the system functions smoothly,” said Momoniat.  He said they must act fast enough on these accounts.  Political Bureau
