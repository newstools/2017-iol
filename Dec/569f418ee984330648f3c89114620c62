South African musician, Cassper Nyovest makes history with his Fill Up stadium concepts. On December 2, Nyovest hosted a total of 68 000 people at FNB Stadium, Soweto. This follows his previous Fill Up concerts, which started in 2015 where he filled up The Dome and last year, Orlando Stadium. Throughout this year, Nyovest has been pushing African and nature related campaign, with his "Mufasa" tag, admiring his Tswana culture.  Styled by Didi Monsta, Nyovest switched in African outfits, making the Tswana culture look cooler than before.
