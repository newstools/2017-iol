South Africa was the centre of attraction and the envy of about 30 countries at the Mozambique International Trade Fair, commonly known as Facim, on Saturday when it scooped two awards at a ceremony hosted by Prime Minister Carlos Agostinho do Rosario. South Africa romped home with the best pavillion award, while Kama Industries, a Johannesburg-based com­pany producing audible and visual signalling devices, was voted the best exhibitor at Facim 2017, the trade and industry department (dti) said on Sunday.
