ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said when paramedics arrived they found a man lying in front of a light motor vehicle. "The man was assessed and found to show no signs of life. CPR and advanced life support was immediately initiated, in an effort to revive the man," said Meiring. Meiring said after 20 minutes, no vital signs returned and the man was declared dead on the scene. "It is believed that a local law enforcement officer had noticed several armed men attempting to hijack another man. The officer then apparently opened fire," said Meiring. Local authorities are investigating. African News Agency
