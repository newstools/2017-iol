Now that Opel is officially here to stay thanks to the Williams Hunt group, albeit still under the General Motors banner until the end of this year, the local Corsa range has been given a bit of a rejig in order to boost showroom traffic. The result is a rationalised hatchback range with slightly lower prices, and less power in the case of the base Essentia model, although conveniently Opel only mentions the “better economy” aspect. The Essentia is still powered by Opel’s impressive little 1-litre, three-cylinder turbopetrol engine, albeit detuned from 85kW to 66kW, while maximum torque remains at 170Nm, between 1700 and 3700rpm. The price has been snipped by R1200, to R200 600 for the base version without air conditioning or radio, assuming that anyone still buys cars without these features, but there is a R4000 overall saving for those opting for the ‘Option Pack 1’ (giving you the aircon, radio and Bluetooth) and bringing the price up to R210 600, which is still highly segment-competitive. Further upstream, the luxurious Cosmo model falls away, leaving a pair of better-appointed Enjoy derivatives to play the entire midrange game. In manual form it still enjoys the full-fat 85kW 1.0T tuning, and costs R234 300, a R500 saving. Yet as before, the Enjoy auto is fitted with a 66kW/130Nm normally aspirated petrol engine and enjoys a R300 price reduction, to R234 800. In spec terms the Enjoy models lose the 60:40 rear seat split as well as the foglights and LED running lamps but they gain the 17.8cm Intellilink infotainment system and a tyre pressure monitoring system. Those opting for the Enjoy Option Pack 1 also get front and rear park assist, Handsfree (semi-automated) Parking and side blind spot alert. At the top of the range, the Corsa Sport, which is powered by a 110kW/220Nm 1.4-litre turbopetrol engine, gains some of the interior “look and feel” features of the discontinued 1.0T Cosmo. This includes a chrome beltline and door handle accents, improved seats upholstered in ‘Morrocana’ fabric, a sunroof, and tyre pressure monitoring. Also included is park assist and side blind spot alert. All models are sold with a five-year/120 000km warranty and three-year/60 000km service plan, which will be honoured by Opel’s new importer after General Motors officially departs at the end of this year.
