 General Manager, Louis Strauss said it was a proud moment  for Jock Safari Lodge to have been recognised for the work done by the Jock Environmental Monitoring Unit whilst also helping with the rehabilitation of Jemu- the rhino abandoned as a result of poachers.  “Jock Safari Lodge places great importance and focus on educating guests about wildlife, conservation and eco-efforts in order to support future generations," said Strauss .
