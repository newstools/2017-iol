Johannesburg - The Constitutional Court is expected to hear the Economic Freedom Fighter’s (EFF) bid on Tuesday, to have President Jacob Zuma impeached and held accountable for lying to Parliament over the Nkandla debacle. EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the EFF application that Parliament "must institute" impeachment proceedings against Zuma came after the ruling by the Constitutional Court that "Zuma broke his oath of office and the constitution of the Republic". "After writing several times to the Speaker of the National Assembly that Zuma must be subjected to a disciplinary hearing to determine if his bridge of the Oath of Office constitutes a "serious" violation of the constitution, she refused," Ndlozi said on Monday.

In March last year, the Constitutional Court delivered a damning ruling in which it stated that Zuma had failed to “uphold, defend and respect the Constitution” when he did not adhere to the remedial actions called for by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. Madonsela issued a report three years ago in which she stated that the millions that went into upgrading Zuma’s Nkandla homestead had not all been rightfully used. Madonsela found that Zuma had derived undue benefit from the security upgrade that spiralled to a cost of more than R200 million and eventually included a swimming pool, cattle kraal and amphitheatre added to Zuma’s home at taxpayer’s cost.
