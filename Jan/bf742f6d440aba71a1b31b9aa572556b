London - Cabin crew at British Airways plan to hold a 48-hour strike from January 10 in an ongoing pay dispute, the Press Association said Tuesday, citing the Unite trade union.The walkout comes after Unite members voted by 7 to 1 to reject a pay offer from the airline, the Press Association reported.Crew called off strikes planned for Christmas Day and Boxing Day to allow for talks at the British conciliation service Acas.&quot;British Airways is needlessly provoking strike action by refusing to extend the mandate of the strike ballot and allow meaningful talks to take place,&quot; Unite official Oliver Richardson said.The strike action is being taken by so-called &quot;mixed fleet&quot; cabin crew who joined the company since 2010. Unite says they are unfairly paid less than their colleagues.&quot;Instead of listening to why its 'mixed fleet' cabin crew rejected the offer negotiated at Acas, British Airways has sought instead to try and bully a workforce of young men and women who are trying to eke out a living on poverty pay,&quot; Richardson said.ANA-dpa
