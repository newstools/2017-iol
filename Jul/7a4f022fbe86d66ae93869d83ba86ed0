Amanda Durand Michau, who claims she lives in Paris, France, and runs a home industry, responded that the young woman must call a farmer. In Afrikaans, she wrote: “Black snake begs for food on Facebook and then I tell her she must phone a farmer!” After a barrage of criticism from members of the group, she responded: “Now I’m famous because I said I don’t feed houtkoppe.” She later wrote: “Kill a farmer, go hungry. And that’s that.” The administrator of the group deleted all her comments, but Michau took to her page, writing in Afrikaans: “They want to eat but they make farmers dead. Wtf now they are begging online nogal. I won’t feed them.” Parkhurst group member Dianne Bayley reported her to Facebook, telling her: “What you have done is considered hate speech, and is unconstitutional. “I’d get a lawyer if I were you. Penny Sparrow also thought she could get away with disgusting racism.” Another user, Alison Sutcliffe, wrote: “What an atrocious excuse for a human. Apartheid is over, Ouma. You need to wake up.” In a post, Facebook user Sammy Parrish described Michau as a “revolting, hateful human!” But Michau termed the response from the “kugels of Parkhurst” the “best soapie, which I in years couldn’t write”. She insisted she could write what she wanted on her own Facebook page. “I am not hiding! I see and read all the comments. I have a right just like any other in this country and I’ll be dammed if you take it from me! My voice gave you freedom! I can take it back! My comments are now on Twitter, the radio and f*** knows what else. I won’t withdraw my comments. Kill a farmer, go hungry!” She later wrote that there were 76 notifications on her timeline.“I got enough k*k today, I’m going to lie down,  otherwise there’s a hit on my life.” Saturday Star
