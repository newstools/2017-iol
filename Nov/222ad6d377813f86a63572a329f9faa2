'Game of Thrones' star Jason Momoa has taken to Instagram to express his excitement ahead shooting starting on 'The Crow Reborn'. The 38-year-old actor has just wrapped up shooting DC Extended Universe movie 'Aquaman' and is now ready to move onto his new project, a reboot of Alex Proyas' 1994 fantasy thriller 'The Crow' - which starred the late Brandon Lee in the title role, who died when he was accidentally shot and killed during filming. Last year, Momoa was revealed to be portraying the titular undead vigilante in the new version - which is to be helmed by Corin Hardy - and Momoa has now taken to Instagram to inform his fans that production is getting ready to begin. Taking to Instagram, the actor posted a picture of the iconic black and white makeup worn by the character and wrote: "I've been waiting for sooooo long. @corinhardy let's do this brother aloha j (sic)" I’ve been waiting for sooooo long. @corinhardy let’s do this brother aloha j A post shared by Jason Momoa (@prideofgypsies) on Nov 12, 2017 at 7:51am PST As with the original movie, the film will be based on the 1989 graphic novel by James O'Barr, but it was previously reported the remake will be more faithful to the original source. Speaking about his shooting schedule, O'Barr revealed previously said: "As of right now, it's slated to start pre-production in February with a very talented British director named Corin Hardy. "I'm involved in every aspect of the film and working closely with the director." The plot focuses on rock musician Eric Draven and his fiancée Shelly who are attacked by a gang of street thugs who shoot the couple, but when Eric dies in the hospital he is resurrected by a crow and then goes on a revenge mission to punish his attackers for killing the love of his life.
