Monterey, California - Some say it takes a real man to wear a pink shirt. All we know is, Mr Michael "Fux" Fuchs must be one seriously macho individual. This truly outrageous, one-of-a-kind McLaren 720S was built to order by the Bespoke division of McLaren Special Operations for entrepreneur and philanthropist Fuchs. It was officially handed over in Monterey by McLaren CEO Mike Flewitt at the weekend, and was displayed in all its metallic pink glory on the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance Concept Lawn on Concours Sunday. Fuchs is well-known in classic car circles as a collector of brightly coloured exotica; he already has a McLaren 12C in the maker’s signature orange, a purple 12C Spider and a bright metallic green P1. And this is not the only pink car he owns; the colour is named Fux Fuchsia, and was originally created for him by Rolls-Royce. McLaren has promised not to offer this particular shade to any other customers without his permission - not, we would think, a difficult promise to make. But wait, as they say, there’s more The interior of the Fux 720S is trimmed throughout in white leather, with white alcantara head-liner and floor mats, all with white stitching - even white cupholders - set off by door appliques, a pinstripe on the steering wheel and rear-view mirror in body colour. Trim elements inside and out are carbon-fibre components from the MSO Defined catalogue, and the exhaust and window surrounds are finished in satin grey. Since this car was built to order, nobody at McLaren will discuss what it cost; suffice it to say that a 720S with full leather interior and alcantara interior starts at R5.5-million. IOL Motoring
