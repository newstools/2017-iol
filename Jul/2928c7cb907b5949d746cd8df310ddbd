JOHANNESBURG - Olympic 800m gold medallist Caster Semenya will likely race for double gold at the IAAF World Championships in London after she requested to be entered for the 1,500m at the global showpiece. Semenya will be the third South African that will race a double at the championships, with world record-holder Wayde van Niekerk going after the 200-400m double and Akani Simbine racing the 100-200m. Announcing the final world championships team following an appeal by athletes that have been left out, Athletics SA (ASA) revealed in a circular that Semenya would attempt the double. “Caster Semenya has appealed to be entered for the IAAF World Championships both the 800m and the 1500m,” the circular read. “ASA has approved the appeal as Caster Semenya is the current CAA African Champion in the 800m and 1500m.” Three more names were added to the team after the IAAF invited the South African women’s 4x400m relay team to participate in the championships. Justine Palframan, Gena Lofstrand, and Ariane Nel will be part of the relay team that also includes Semenya and 400m hurdles ace Wenda Nel, who have already qualified. World Student Games 400m champion Palframan will also be racing in the 200m while Lofstrand will be able to compete in the 800m.
