#DontLookAway when you hear someone verbally abusing another person, says Claudia Burger, Director of Activist Network Against the Exploitation of Children. Slut-shaming, body-shaming, wolf-whistling and gay-shaming are just some of the verbal assaults that can do psychological damage.​ Cruel words cause harm, not just to the person the words are directed at, but also others who hear it, because they then think it is acceptable. It is not. No-one deserves to feel bad about themselves based on unkind words expressed by others. Burger's advice is to call it out.
