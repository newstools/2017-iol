Raspberry and Ginger Trifle (BBC Good Food) Ingredients 150 ml medium-sweet Sherry 2 x 300 g packs cream cheese 600 ml double cream 50 g icing sugar, sifted 2 x 250 g packs gingernut biscuits 2 x 200 g punnets of raspberries Method Put 50 ml of the alcohol in a bowl with the cream cheese and beat with an electric whisk until smooth. Add the cream and sugar and beat again until well mixed and softly whipped. Using a pastry brush, quickly brush a gingernut biscuit with a little of the remaining alcohol. Stack, brushed-side down, on a cake plate or stand, then repeat to make a large round base of biscuits. Spread over a layer of cream, squish in some raspberries, then repeat with another layer of biscuits, pressing down slightly to stick. Repeat layers, finishing with a fourth layer of cream and raspberries. Cover with an upturned mixing bowl, or very loosely with cling film, then chill until ready to serve. Itâ€™s good after 2 hrs, but could be made the day before, too. Serve with a sprinkling of crushed gingernut biscuit.
