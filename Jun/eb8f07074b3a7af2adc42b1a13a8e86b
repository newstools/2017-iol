Woking, England – McLaren has unveiled the open-air version of its 570S and as you’d expect, the British supercar maker has done everything in its power to minimise the dynamic compromises that come with chopping a car’s roof off. Most importantly, structural rigidity is unchanged, says McLaren, while the roof adds a weight penalty, over the 570S Coupé, of just 45kg. Set to make its debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed on June 29, the 570S Spider features an electrically-retractable two-piece hardtop that can open or close at speeds of up to 40km/h. Also included is a button-operated glazed rear window/wind deflector. The 570S Spider is powered by a mid-mounted 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 rated at 419kW and 600Nm, and allegedly capable of catapulting the supercar from 0-100km/h in just 3.2 seconds and up to a top speed of 328km/h, matching the Coupé on both counts. The engine drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed sequential-shift gearbox. The hand-assembled McLaren is built around a carbon fibre MonoCell II chassis and features adjustable double-wishbone suspension at all four corners, offering the driver a choice between Normal, Sport and Track modes. The car rides on new 10-spoke alloy wheels, measuring 19 inches in diameter upfront and 20 inches at the back. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
