This follows the negative trends observed in the first half of the year continuing in the second half due to ongoing difficult economic conditions and increased pressure on consumers. Liberty also experienced abnormally higher risk claims in the South African Individual Arrangements and Liberty Corporate businesses, contributing to reduced risk profits in the second half and reduced earnings from Stanlib.This was because of operational write-offs in both the South African and East African asset management businesses and the costs incurred on the implementation of the outsourcing of the local retail administration function, it says. Management has taken action to address persistency and the operational issues in the group. The customer facing units continue to write good business and attract client flows. The group remains profitable and well capitalised within its target range. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE&nbsp;
