NEW YORK – World number one Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic advanced to the US Open quarter-finals on Monday by routing 91st-ranked American Jennifer Brady 6-1 6-0 in just 46 minutes. Pliskova, last year’s US Open runner-up, will next face either 37th-ranked compatriot Lucie Safarova or US 20th seed CoCo Vandeweghe to decide a berth in the semi-finals. “It’s very good for Czech tennis that there are so many of us,” she said of the chance to play Safarova. In her prior match, Pliskova faced a match point against China’s Zhang Shuai, a tense moment that helped her ensure there was no drama against Brady. “I played well,” she said. “I really wanted to get the chance that I got after that match point. Definitely that match helped me to go through tough moments, and this match, I was much better.” The victory kept Pliskova in contention to retain her top ranking after the Open. She must reach the final to stay number one. AFP
