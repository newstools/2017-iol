Frankfurt Motor Show - Suzuki used the Frankfurt show to spill the beans on the technical workings of its all-new Suzuki Swift Sport, following the release of the first pictures last month, and the big news is that it’s now turbocharged. The previous high-revving normally aspirated 1.6-litre petrol four makes way for a 1.4-litre ‘Boosterjet’ turbopetrol and while power is only marginally up, from 100kW to 103kW, maximum torque increases substantially, from 160Nm to 230Nm. The car also 80kg lighter than before. Thanks to it being based on Suzuki’s new ‘Heartect’ platform, the new Swift Sport has a kerb weight of just 970kg. The new force-fed direct injection engine delivers its urge much lower in the rev range. While maximum power was previously produced at 6900rpm, it’s now delivered at 5500rpm, while torque now peaks between 2500rpm and 3500rpm, versus the previous engine’s 4400rpm. Petrolheads might not enjoy the new motor’s less revvy nature, but the purists among them will appreciate that the engine is still mated to a good old fashioned six-speed manual gearbox. The Swift Sport also gets beefed up suspension and a racy body kit that includes a bolder bumper and grille as well as side skirts and a bold diffuser, housing two huge tailpipes. Inside it’s set apart by sports seats, red inlays, a flat-bottomed steering wheel as well as additional gauges (for boost and oil temperature).
Suzuki’s new Swift range is set to make its SA debut during the first half of next year, hopefully with the Sport version in hot pursuit.   IOL Motoring
