It has been an open secret that Sundowns want to lure Ngoma to Pretoria. The Brazilins made three attempts in the previous transfer window to sign Ngoma but all of them failed. Comitis confirmed on Wednesday that he has given Sundowns a proposal regarding Ngoma. Independent Media reported last week that Sundowns will make another bid to try and buy Ngoma. “Aubrey told us earlier during the season that he wants to join Sundowns. "If they strike the deal then we will talk. "We need to be realistic. He hasn’t played much (because of an injury). He has done well in the little game time he has had. But we can’t hang onto player whose mind is else-where. "We gave Sundowns the proposal and they know what they need to do if they want to have Aubrey,” Comitis explained. Ngoma has made a huge difference  to City since returning from the injury that kept him out of the start of the season. He has contributed with assists and goals. City want to replace Ngoma with Mogakolodi Ngele who has found it hard to get game time at Sundowns. Yesterday the club announced that their top marksman Lehlohonolo “Major” Majoro is heading out the door. “Major was left with six months on his contract. He is 32 and if we going to pay top dollar we need to know that he will play week in  and week out which is something that hasn’t be happening. "For the sake of the boy we thought let us release him because he has already had an offer. We respected the fact that the club that he is joining might give him an extension beyond his contract with us. "We still have Judas Moseamedi who will come back from an injury,” Comitis stated. City are eyeing Mohammed Anas to replace Majoro. They will face competition from Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits. Anas is still contracted to Free State Stars until the end of the season.
