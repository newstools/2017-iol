There is a new five star hotel in Rwanda that is filled with luxury, opulence and elegance. Dubbed as one of the new hotels to visit in Africa this year, Kigali Marriott Hotel is located along KN3 Avenue in the city centre, near the financial district and Kigali City Hall. For those visiting Rwanda’s capital, the hotel is perfect for all types of travellers, be it business, family or leisure. The fact that it is fully connected with the internet means that you do not have to worry about not having time for loved ones.  There are 229 rooms and 25 suites. The rooms are kitted with individual climate control, mini bar, a television with satellite and marble bathrooms . While the pictures speak for themselves, there is a lot to be done at the hotel, including taking a  dip in the outdoor pool, work out the extra calories in the fitness gym or relax with a spa treatment. Those wanting to explore the area can enjoy some of the close by attractions. Gorilla trekking and visits to Lake Kivu and Volcanoes National Park come highly recommended by locals. Rooms start from R2 800 per a night. Here are some pictures to whet your wanderlust:
