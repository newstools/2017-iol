Meghan Markle is having round the clock security because of her high profile romance with Prince Harry. The 'Suits' actress has reportedly been given protection 24 hours a day due to her high profile romance with Prince Harry. And DailyMailTV reports that the security team have been hired in Toronto and it has been claimed that it is being paid by NBC Universal, who make her show 'Suits'. A resident living near Meghan revealed: "She [Meghan] hasn't been around much for the last few days - Friday night they were here. I tell you, when he's [Harry] here, the street is full of police and security people. They just go straight in and they don't come out." Whilst builder Mike, who is working in the same street, added: "She usually has guys in a dark car - I've seen them escorting her in and they try to shield her a bit. She's very nice - I saw her the other day and she smiled and waved at us. The owner of this house knows Meghan very well; she's good friends with her. "When I started working here, she told me not to worry if I see security stepped up because that means Harry is here. She has her own security people but when he is here, there are more." It comes after body language expert Dr. Lillian Glass revealed Harry is more "relaxed" with Meghan than his previous girlfriends. She said: "First of all, we've never seen Harry this relaxed with anybody. That's number one. Every girl he's been with, there's kind of been a distancing, an uptightness about him, a real formality. But with Meghan you really see there's a connection."
