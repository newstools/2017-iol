Zayn Malik's cousin has tragically passed away at the age of five. The former One Direction singer's family have been left heartbroken by the passing of Arshiya, who died in the early hours on Tuesday morning, March 28, after a bravely-fought battle with a brain tumour. Captioning a picture of Arshiya, her mother Zileh wrote on Instagram: "An angel wrote in the book of life my baby's date of birth, then whispered as she closed the book.. 'Too beautiful for earth' R.I.P baby doll.. #keeparshiyainyourduas (sic)" Whilst Zayn's youngest sister Waliyha wrote on her own social media account: "Rest is peace you beautiful princess, may Allah grant you the highest rank of Jannah (sic)" A post shared by @waliyha.azad on Mar 27, 2017 at 7:03pm PDT Arshiya had been battling the brain tumour for a few years and the family had regularly taken to social media to ask for fans' prayers. Aaroosa Malik wrote back in 2014: "Doctors have given up on Arshiya but she is still fighting brave like a soldier. Can everyone please pray for her and anyone out there with a medical background or any doctor who thinks they can help please get in touch if possible ... They operated on her twice. She hasn't come round since. They thought she was brain dead but she's not." Zayn had reportedly always been close to his late cousin and was constantly on the phone for updates about her condition when he was jetting back and forth across the globe for work. When Arshiya was undergoing operations, a source said: "Zayn loves all his family to bits but is really close to Arshiya. He has never been off the phone since she was taken into hospital and has told his family he will be at her bedside as soon as he can." Zayn has yet to comment publicly about Arshiya's tragic passing but fans have rushed to social media to send their condolences to the family. Bang Showbiz
