CAPE TOWN – All Black wing Nehe Milner-Skudder’s dismal injury run continues, with the All Blacks confirming on Monday that a shoulder problem will sideline him for six months. Milner-Skudder left the field during New Zealand’s nail-biting 25-24 win over South Africa at Newlands on Saturday after dislocating his right shoulder. Coach Steve Hansen confirmed the 26-year-old would require an operation. “Dislocated shoulder. Will require surgery. Expected to be out for six months,” Hansen said on the All Blacks’ official Twitter feed. Milner-Skudder enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2015, helping the All Blacks to World Cup victory with six tries in the tournament. But since then he has missed almost two years of international rugby due to a string of injuries. A dislocated left shoulder sidelined him for the entire 2016 season, but then he returned to Super Rugby in March this year, only to break his foot after two games. He made his latest comeback against Argentina last month and had scored three tries in three Tests before his injury curse struck again. AFP
