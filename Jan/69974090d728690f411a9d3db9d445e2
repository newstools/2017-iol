Johannesburg Congress of SA Trade Unions ( Cosatu) on Friday thanked ANC leaders for attending the 22nd commemoration of former SACP leader Joe Slovo in Soweto after years of absence. Cosatu secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said as members of the tripartite alliance with the ANC, Cosatu has been wondering why none of the ANC NEC members attended the event over the years. &quot;We could not understand in the past, why the whole NEC could not send a member to attend... But we won't delve into that. We're happy to see you Deputy President (Cyril Ramaphosa) and others, because Joe Slovo was the embodiment of our movement,&quot; said Ntshalintshali. The 22nd commemoration of former SACP leader Joe Slovo was underway at his burial site at Soweto's Avalon Cemetery. Ntshalintshali said 2017 was going to be a difficult year for the alliance. &quot;This year represents hard work. The issue of free higher education calls on all of us to fight for the poor and the working class and ensure that the poor get free education.&quot; Cabinet ministers including Dipuo Peters and Naledi Pandor, Thulas Nxesi were at the event, along with Gauteng Premier David Makhura and former ANC deputy secretary Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele. Leaders of the SACP and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) also attended the event. The trade union federation formed in 1985, is part of the tripartite alliance along with the SACP. Ramaphosa was due to address the event. African News Agency
