When Peugeot first revealed its 'new' one-tonne Pick-Up earlier this year, bakkie fans were left more than a little underwhelmed, considering the Dongfeng-based pick-up has (Nissan) roots dating back almost two decades. Stranger still was news that Peugeot had only earmarked the one-tonner for South African introduction in 2021, leading us to assume that we’d in fact be getting a newer version of the bakkie. That puzzle is now coming together with news that Peugeot is in fact planning to launch an all-new bakkie abroad in 2020. According to Automotive News Europe, Peugeot is developing the new pick-up in conjunction with Changan Automotive, and the newcomer will be aimed at global markets. The latter is almost certainly the vehicle that's destined for South Africa, as our contact at Peugeot SA confirmed to us that our market will not receive the Dongfeng-based bakkie in the picture above. Rather, the SA-bound model will be a "pure Peugeot built from the ground up with Peugeot technology." According to the report, the new pick-up will be engineered “to meet world standards” which is certainly not something we’d expect of the current Dongfeng-based vehicle, which is aimed specifically at African markets, ours excluded. Peugeot is one of many recent newcomers to the global pick-up arena, following Renault and Mercedes, with their Nissan Navara-based Alaskan and X-Class bakkies and Fiat with its Mitsubishi Triton-based Fullback.
