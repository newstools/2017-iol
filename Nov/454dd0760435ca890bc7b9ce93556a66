Twitter is at it like a hive of worker bees trying to ascertain if the snaps circulating on social media are really that of Britain's one and only — David Beckham. A series of snaps and eyewitnesses claim that either they — or their mother — has seen the hunky footballer in Maboneng, Johannesburg. Senior staff of Woodlands International College in Boksburg spotted Beckham at Arts on Main in Joburg's Maboneng precinct and grabbed the once in a lifetime opportunity to take a number of pictures of the former England star. See some of the snaps below.  Beckham is clearly 'November Man' of SA visits, as he last visited the country when he was a speaker at the Discovery Leadership Summit held in Sandton, Johannesburg, last November. The football legend is a long-standing UN Children’s Fund (Unicef) ambassador, he has created the David Beckham Unicef Fund, which represents his commitment over the next decade to helping the world’s most vulnerable children. So he might be in town for World Children’s Day on 20 November. Either way, we're just glad he's in town.
