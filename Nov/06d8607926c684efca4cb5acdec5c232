Not sure what to pack in your carry-on luggage? Here are some quick tips for making the most of your 7kg allowance: Choose the right bag Remember to carry just 7 kilograms of carry-on luggage with you. Weigh the bags before you leave for the airport. Choose bags that can fit in the overhead compartment as keeping large bags are prohibited on the plane. Keep the essentials Try to stick to the essentials when you pack your carry on luggage. Try to avoid taking any gels and liquids that exceeds 100ml or any items that could have been packed in your check in luggage. Carry an extra pair of clothing Anything could happen on a plane that may require a change of clothing. By taking an extra pair of clothing, one can prepare for any disaster or for the weather at your selected destination. Arrive early No one wants to have their bags stored 10 rows away from where they sit, therefore it is a good idea to board early. This will allow you to store your bags in the compartment allocated to you. There are travellers who end up storing their bags in other compartments because they arrive late, which could cause conflict among travellers. The last thing you need on your holiday is a fight.
