PARIS – Petra Kvitova swept to a tearful French Open victory on Sunday in her first match since surviving a horrifying knife attack which almost ended her career. The two-time Wimbledon champion downed outclassed Julia Boserup of the United States 6-3 6-2, falling to her knees in celebration before weeping at the net. “I’m really glad to have made the decision to play here,” said 27-year-old Kvitova, who was seriously hurt when she tackled an armed intruder at her home in the eastern Czech town of Prostejov in December. “Thank you for everything, you helped me through this difficult time. “I won the match today, but I knew I had already won,” she added in reference to the initial nightmare scenario in which she feared she’d lose the fingers on her left playing hand. Kvitova, the 15th seed and a semi-finalist in Roland Garros in 2012, fired nine aces and 31 winners past Boserup, making her debut at the tournament at the age of 25. Czech star Kvitova will face Bethanie Mattek-Sands or Evgeniya Rodina in the next round. Olympic champion Monica Puig sent veteran Italian Roberta Vinci to her 10th first-round loss in 13 visits to Paris, winning 6-3 3-6 6-2. AFP
