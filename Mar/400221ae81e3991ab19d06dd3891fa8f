It was another masterclass from the flying Rosko Specman as the Blitzboks easily dealt with hosts Canada to advance to the Vancouver Sevens Cup semi-finals on Sunday night. The Springbok Sevens will take on USA in the last-four clash at eight minutes after midnight on Monday (12.08am). Specman cut the Canadians to shreds with his quick feet and changes of angle to mesmerise the opposition’s defence. The dreadlocked speedster opened the scoring with a typically brilliant individual effort as he stepped this way and that to wrong-foot the Canadians.   The speed of movement from the South Africans was too much to handle for the home side, and Siviwe Soyizwapi soon went over for the second try. Canada, inspired by a cheering home crowd at BC Place stadium, hit back through Justin Douglas, with an excellent touchline conversion from Nathan Hirayama reducing the deficit to just five points at 12-7. But it was Specman who once again sparked a five-pointer for the Blitzboks with a scintillating line-break, and Chris Dry rounded off. Soyizwapi recorded a hat trick in the end, while Cecil Afrika added a try to his three conversions as the South Africans remained on course for a fifth tournament title out of six in the current World Series season. Points-Scorers Blitzboks – Tries: Rosko Specman, Siviwe Soyizwapi (3), Chris Dry, Cecil Afrika. Conversions: Cecil Afrika (3). Canada – Try: Justin Douglas. Conversion: Nathan Hirayama (1). @ashfakmohamed IOL
