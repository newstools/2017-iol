Naspers is not afraid of making big-ticket acquisitions
abroad. It is often argued that Africa’s largest tech company
owes most of its financial success of late to well-placed foreign investments,
not least its well-publicised 34 percent stake in China’s Tencent. Now, after making big e-learning bets in the US in 2016—
by spending R802 million and R200 million on Udemy and Brainly respectively,
through its latest multi-billion rand acquisition, Naspers is intent on carving
out a fair share of America’s super-competitive online classifieds market. In this Tech Minute, Brian Lupiya reveals which American
app has had the good fortune of landing this sizeable investment. Also, be
sure to listen in to learn how a new digital platform launched by Mastercard is
helping East African farmers market their produce more profitably. See also: LISTEN: African Tech Roundup: Agritech plays Be sure to check out the latest episode of the African
