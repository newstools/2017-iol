DURBAN – Dan Malesela is the favourite to take over as the coach of Polokwane City. Independent Media has been reliably informed that Malesela is set to take over from Bernard Molekwa at Rise and Shine. Malesela recently parted ways with Chippa United, and Molekwa is acting as an interim coach at Polokwane. “Polokwane City will announce Dan Malesela in the next few days. He has been in negotiations with City for the past two weeks. The club owner was one the one that was dictating terms. The owner John Mogaladi was the one who was deciding who to play,” a well-placed source revealed. Molekwa will return to his duties as the team manager, following Polokwane’s 1-0 defeat to Cape Town City on Friday. He took charge of Polokwane in March following the sudden departure of Luc Eymael, and led the club to their highest ever finish in the Absa Premiership as they ended sixth last season. But in the 2017/18 season so far, Rise and Shine have lost four out of six games in the league, and have won just one and drawn one to languish in second-last place on the log. Polokwane City were also knocked out of the MTN8 in the quarter-finals by Cape Town City. An effort to get hold of Polokwane spokesperson Vusi Mtimane proved futile as his phone was off. @minenhlecr7  Isolezwe, IOL Sport
