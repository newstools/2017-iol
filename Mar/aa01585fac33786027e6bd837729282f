Johannesburg - A consortium of banks including Guaranty Trust Bank,
Access Bank and Zenith Bank have reportedly assumed control of Etisalat Nigeria
after the Nigerian Communications Commission and the Central Bank of Nigeria failed
to get the feuding parties to agree on renewed repayment terms linked to a
large loan facility. The funding, which was sourced in 2015, is said to have
involved a foreign-backed guaranty bond secured to finance major network
rehabilitation projects, as well as to bankroll the expansion of Etisalat's
operations in Nigeria. However, media reports suggest that Etisalat has failed
to meet its debt servicing obligations since 2016, and that the mobile network
operator has cited Nigeria's challenging recessionary environment as the reason
for their inability to pay up. Also in this week's Tech Minute, Brian Lupiya shares news
of yet another international video-on-demand player that is set to launch a
subscription service in seven African countries including South Africa, Kenya
and Nigeria this June. BUSINESS REPORT
