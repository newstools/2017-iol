Kia has released the first picture of a stylish new concept car ahead of its full reveal at the Frankfurt Motor Show on September 12. As it goes with these ‘teasers’ no much is being disclosed ahead of its actual unveiling, we don’t even know the name yet, but Kia has stated that the show car previews the next-generation Cee’d. The Cee’d (available as a hatch and wagon) is what Kia sells to Europeans instead of the Cerato and if this is really what Kia has in store for its next Golf challenger then we can only hope that the Cerato's replacement also swallows some of the same potion. While in our eyes it looks very much like a sleek station wagon with hints of the Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo, Kia refers to the concept as an “extended hot hatch” that has “real-world versatility.” Yet it is different enough to a conventional wagon for Kia to call it a “new body type”, and the company says that it is a “potential member” of the next-generation Cee’d line-up.
