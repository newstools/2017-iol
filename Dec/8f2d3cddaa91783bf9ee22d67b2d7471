Makes two dozen using a 5cm biscuit cutter Ingredients 115 g butter, softened, plus additional melted 50 g light brown sugar 50 g ground almonds 135 g plain flour ¼ tsp baking powder ¼ tsp salt ¼ cupful of mixed seeds: nigella, sesame, cumin, caraway, celery Method Preheat oven to 175°C. Cream the butter and sugar together. Stir in the ground almonds. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together then add to the creamed mixture. Using your fingertips, rub the flour and creamed mixtures together until it resembles coarse crumbs. Bring it together into a block, wrap in cling film and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to about the depth of a pound coin. Use a small biscuit cutter or a glass and cut out rounds. Place the rounds on a baking tray lined with a silicone sheet or baking parchment. Brush each round with some of the melted butter and dust generously with the mixed seeds. Bake in the oven for around 10 minutes until the biscuits turn golden brown. Leave the biscuits to cool on the pan for five minutes then remove them to a cooling rack. Store in an airtight container.
