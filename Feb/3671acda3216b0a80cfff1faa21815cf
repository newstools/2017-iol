Large bowl Measuring cups Measuring spoons Sieve Wooden spoon Pizza cutter/knife Rolling pin Pastry brush Baking tray/foil Ingredients: Pizza dough ½ cup self raising flour 15g margarine/butter 2 tablespoons milk Filling (your choice) ¼ cup cheddar cheese slice of ham 1 tablespoon pineapple 1 tablespoon of tomato puree  OVEN: 180ºC, Prep time: 20 minutes, Cooking time: 10 to 20 minutes Preheat your oven to 180ºC. Sift flour into a mixing bowl. Add butter to the flour, then pinch and rub the flour and butter together so it looks like breadcrumbs. Pour in the milk and use your hands to make a dough ball. Lightly flour the table and rolling pin using the flour. Roll the dough into a thin and flat rectangular shape. Spread the tomato puree on to the dough, very thin, like jam on toast with a knife. On a chopping board grate the cheese and chop the ham and pineapple into small blocks, place all over the dough rectangle. Once you have placed your toppings, slowly roll up the dough from one end to the other into a long roll. Using a sharp knife, gently cut the roll up into 2cm wheels. Place the rolls onto the baking sheet. Bake for 10 – 20 minutes until golden brown and cooked through. Once baked, remove from oven and allow to cool.
