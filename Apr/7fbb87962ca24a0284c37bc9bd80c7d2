Johannesburg – Mazda has extended its Mazda2 model line-up with seventh derivative, the Mazda2 Individual Plus 1.5L Auto, that brings a number of new features to the range, which are also available on the Hazumi 1.5 turbodiesel. But they come at a cost: While the prices of the rest of the range have risen by an average of less than 2.2 percent, the new Individual Plus is a whopping R42 900 more expensive than the previous top petrol model, and the price of the Hazumi diesel has gone up by R33 900, or 11.4 percent. So what do you get for all that extra cash? Quite a lot, actually. The two top Mazda variants now boast full leather seats, a head up display for current speed, next turn directions from the satellite navigation and safety alerts, rear parking sensors, a shark fin antenna, lane departure warning, and side and curtain airbags, while the Hazumi now also has blind spot monitoring. But wait, there’s more: All Mazda2 derivatives except the base Active model now have LED fog-lights and cruise control, and the automatics now come with paddle shifters. Still the same are the petrol models’ 1.5 litres, 82kW and 145Nm, and the 77kW and 250Nm outputs of the 1.5 turbodiesel four, as well as the three-year, unlimited distance warranty and three-year service plan across the range.
