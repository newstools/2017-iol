CAPE TOWN - A local Spar in Limpopo burnt down in September this year, leaving 148 workers facing unemployment.  The owner then decided to keep his workers employed, finding alternative work for them to do.  On September 23, 2017, the Superspar in Bela Bela, Limpopo, burnt down in a tragic fire.  The owner then faced a loss of business and the grave warning of 148 jobs being threatened. Some of the employees have worked at the store for more than 17 years.  Instead of letting them fall into unemployment, the owner embarked on a drive to find alternative work for his workers.  The I AM SPAR project was then born. The project, employed workers by having them engage in charity projects around the city while the store was being rebuilt.  According to Superspar Bela Bela, the project divided the staff into teams and they are currently working at the old age home, schools, hospitals and even at the local police station.     READ: Only 28% of SA businesses build employees skills Since beginning the project, the staff members have collectively done more than 30 000 man hours of community service.  From painting schools to building churches and cultivated vegetable gardens for the poorer communities and even refurbished the hospital.  The decision to pay the staff while doing charity work has also inspired the community. “To the spar owner, you are the kind of person or a leader that is needed in our communities, instead of cutting jobs you found a way to keep them in a more useful way. A person who deserve our support. I live in modimolle but I’m definitely coming to bela bela spar to support when it reopen”, said community member Lydia Kgaugelo Motshegoa.     READ ALSO: Denel needs R600 million to pay withheld salaries TOP STORY: Steinhoff: Wiese family's dominance under fire - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
