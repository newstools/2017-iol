AGEN, France – Former Springbok scrumhalf Ricky Januarie has signed for French Top 14 new boys Agen for next season, the club announced on Friday. The 35-year-old helped La Rochelle top the regular season standings and reach the Top 14 semi-finals this year, but was only a substitute in last weekend's 18-15 defeat to Toulon. Januarie, who has been visibly carrying a little extra weight in recent seasons, first came to France in 2011 when he joined Lyon. The 47-time capped half-back, who had previously played for the Lions, Western Province and Ospreys in Wales, has signed a one year deal with an option for another 12 months. He is one of four new additions to the Agen squad as they bid to build a side capable of surviving in the Top 14 – they were relegated at the first time of asking in 2015/2016. Hooker Loick Jammes, 22, joins from relegated Grenoble, Georgian prop Gagi Bazadze, 24, arrives from Montpellier and wing Nicolas Metge is leaving fellow promoted side Oyonnax to head to Agen.
