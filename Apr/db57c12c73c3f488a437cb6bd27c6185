As the process continues to decide which South African Super Rugby teams should be cut in 2018, there is a chance that those two sides and a few others could play in the UK going forward. It is understood that Premiership Rugby, the equivalent of Sanzaar in Britain who run rugby in the region, are investigating the chances of including SA teams in the Anglo-Welsh Cup, according to Sky Sports. The competition format of the Cup is set to expand from the 2019-2020 season. At the moment, there are 12 English clubs and four Welsh sides in the tournament. The new version of the event could take place in the November Test window, as well as in February and March. Sanzaar announced recently that they will cut the Super Rugby competition from 18 teams to 15, with two franchises from South Africa and one from Australia to make way. The Force and Rebels are under threat Down Under, while the Southern Kings and Cheetahs have been mentioned as possible candidates to lose their Super Rugby status.
