Vanderbijlpark - Two men were killed and three other people were injured when a motorcycle crashed into the back of a bakkie on the N1 in Vanderbijlpark late on Friday night, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene and found the 4x4 bakkie on its side on the side of the road, ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said on Saturday. "Two people were found walking around on the scene while two others were found inside the vehicle. Provincial services were already in attendance, assessing the patients. The body of the biker, along with his vehicle, was found some distance away lying in the centre median." Paramedics assessed the biker and found that he had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done by paramedics and the man was declared dead on the scene. The four injured people, two men, a woman, and a young child, had been in the bakkie when it rolled. Assessment showed that one man had sustained serious injuries while the three others sustained moderate injuries. Paramedics treated the patients and provided the seriously injured man with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, the patients were transported to Mediclinic Emfuleni Hospital for further care. "Unfortunately, after a short time in hospital, the seriously injured man succumbed to his injuries." The details surrounding the accident were not yet known, Meiring said. African News Agency
