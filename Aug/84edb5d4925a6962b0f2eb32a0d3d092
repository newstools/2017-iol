Uptight Eleanor and restless Richard have ploughed everything into a house in East London. Richard adores it, but Eleanor is not so sure. There’s a weird atmosphere on the top floor and deranged scribbles hint all was not well with their predecessors. Money is tight, so they get a lodger - the slightly tarty, unfocused Zoe. She’s Eleanor’s absolute opposite, but who is Eleanor these days? What is upstairs? The tension tightens to a spectacular conclusion, but is the thing in the attic real evil, or just an accretion of everyone’s bad side? This superbly written debut offers a Turn Of The Screw-ish take on the domestic horror genre. Loot.co.za (R256)
