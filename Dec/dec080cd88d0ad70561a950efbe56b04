JOHANNESBURG – Ajax Cape Town marksman Prince Nxumalo, who wants out of the Urban Warriors, is likely to replace Leonardo Castro at Mamelodi Sundowns. Independent Media have been informed that Sundowns are serious about bringing Nxumalo on board next month. Castro has left the Brazilians and he will plying his trade with Kaizer Chiefs. Khama Billiat is also expected to leave the league leaders in January. Sacked Ajax coach Stanley Menzo said before his departure that Nxumalo was missing and he wasn’t prepared to work with such an ill-disciplined player. Sundowns now see Nxumalo as a perfect replacement for Castro. “Sundowns want to sign Nxumalo. Sundowns boss Pitso Mosimane has already met with Nxumalo. He has made his intention very clear about working with him. The boy also is keen on joining Sundowns. Ajax want a million so that they can release him. Bidvest Wits (are) also monitoring his situation,” a source stated. Nxumalo has struggled for game time this season, with Menzo questioning his attitude and application. “Nxumalo doesn’t want to play for Ajax anymore. Sundowns are also willing to pay that million. The boy has made it clear that it is time to make money now and get a new challenge. The club may be forced to release him now because he will leave for free in June,” the source elaborated. Nxumalo’s current contract with Ajax is set to expire in June. He will leave the club for free in June if they don’t sell him now. Sundowns spokesperson Thulani Thuswa, however, said he doesn’t know anything about Nxumalo joining the club. “I don’t know anything about what you are asking me about. That is news to me to be honest,” Thuswa explained. An attempt to get hold of Shoes Mekuto and Milo Boer who are in the communication department at Ajax proved futile. @Minenhlecr7  Cape Times  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
