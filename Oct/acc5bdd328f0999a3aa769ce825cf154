The R&B superstar is up for the prestigious Artist of the Year prize and will battle it out with Ed Sheeran, Drake, Kendrick Lamar and The Chainsmokers to be crowed the winner. The 32-year-old star is also up for Video of the Year and Favourite song for 'That's What I Like', Favourite Artist (Rock/Pop), Favourite Male Artist and Favourite Album for '24K Magic'. Ed, 26,  has been nominated for Video of The Year, Favourite Song and Favourite Soundtrack for 'Shape Of You', as well as, Favourite Male Artist and Favourite Artist. And hip-hop star Kendrick Lamar is a big contender to bag some prizes on the night as he has the chance to take home Artist of The Year, Favourite Artist (rap/hip-hop), Favourite Album for 'DAMN' and Favourite Song for 'Humble'. Whilst males dominate the categories, Alessia Cara, Lady Gaga and Rihanna are also in the running to be honoured for an award as they are set to go head-to-head to be crowned Favourite Female Artist.
