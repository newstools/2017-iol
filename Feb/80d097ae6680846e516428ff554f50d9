Leeu Collection’s hospitality portfolio currently comprises three five-star boutique properties in South Africa:  Leeu Estates, a 17-room country house retreat and boutique winery in the Franschhoek valley,  Leeu House, an exclusive 12-room hotel in the heart of Franschhoek village;  Le Quartier Français, a romantic 21-room hotel also located in the village, adjacent to Le Quartier Français the 3-bedroom LQF Villa recently opened.
