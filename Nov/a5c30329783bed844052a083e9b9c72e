Alexis took to Instagram to share a few snaps of their wedding and paid tribute to his new wife. He wrote: "You are the greatest of all time, not just in sport--Iâ€™m talking about as a mother and as a wife. I am so excited to write so many more chapters of our fairy tale together. And my whole life I didnâ€™t even realize it, but I was waiting for this moment.And everything that I have done, everything that I am so proud of in my career, and in my life, for the last 34 years, pales in comparison to what weâ€™re doing today. And I am so grateful, and I am so in love. (sic) @serenawilliams: You are the greatest of all time, not just in sport--Iâ€™m talking about as a mother and as a wife.
