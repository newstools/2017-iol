Dearborn, Michigan - Ford is going big with its 2017 Super Bowl television commercial. The 90 second ad, which will be shown just before the kick-off on Monday 6 February, is not so much about cars as it is about “long term mobility solutions”. Set to a superb recording by Nina Simone of “I wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Free”, it tells a number of cute little stories about how people - particularly young people - get stuck, and how they get free. And freedom, in Ford’s world, encompasses concepts such as bike sharing, autonomous driving and plug-in hybrids, as well as the new GT supercar. As vice president of global dealer and consumer experience Elena Ford explained: “We’re always going to make cars, that’s a very important part of our business, but as the landscape changes, we want to be a part of that. "We want to showcase to customers what our ideas are, and we want to get feedback from them."   IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
