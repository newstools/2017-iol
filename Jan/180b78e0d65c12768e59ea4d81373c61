London Fresh strikes have been called at British Airways and the London underground rail network for February, adding to recent travel chaos in the capital city.Employees of British Airways will strike from February 5 to February 7 and again from February 9 to February 11, Unite Union said Friday.Employees of the London underground will also strike on February 5 and February 7, in protest at planned job cuts.Londoners were hit by travel chaos earlier this month when the rail network staged a day-long strike over low staffing.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan condemned that strike, saying it had caused &quot;misery to millions of Londoners.&quot;Just as the company has done during past strikes, British Airways plans to reroute its customers to other flights on the strike days, so that every customer reaches his or her destination, a spokesman said.The strikes at the company are part of an ongoing wage battle. dpa
