Johannesburg Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Monday hit back at Gupta-owned Oakbay in a 103-page affidavit.Gordhan s affidavit, which should have been lodged on Friday in response to one from Oakbay, was delayed because he has just returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos and is preparing for the budget on February 22.In his response, Gordhan notes that Oakbay is now making the belated concession that the minister cannot intervene in banks affairs.The current legal debacle started last year when Gordhan asked the courts to confirm that he had no power to intervene in banks relationships with its customers.Several banks and companies cut ties last year with Oakbay, without publicly disclosing their reasons. They included South Africa s top four banks: Standard Bank, Nedbank, Barclays Africa s Absa, FNB and Standard Bank.Gordhan also notes Oakbay wants his application to fail, even though it concedes that his position is correct in law.However, he points out that Oakbay wants the big 4 banks probed because they are aided by the South African Reserve Bank and, therefore, not fully independent.This, he asserts, is an inconsistency in its affidavit.Gordhan also argues that Oakbay s allegations are spurious and have no merit, and notes that the company did not challenge the validity of the Financial Intelligence Centre certificate.Gordhan s affidavit follows a recent one in which Oakbay said Gordhan s initial application to the court was flawed.In a statement issued by lawyers Van der Merwe &amp; Associates at the time, Oakbay argued Gordhan s superfluous application is riddled with factual and legal errors .Last October, Gordhan revealed in a court affidavit that R6.8 billion in payments made by Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, companies they controlled and other individuals with the same surname had been reported to the authorities as suspicious since 2012.Oakbay has previously said all 72 transactions were approved by the banks processing them.Last April, the government told Gordhan and two other cabinet ministers to contact the banks to discuss their decision to cease doing business with the Gupta companies.The banks refused to give details, saying their dealings with clients were confidential.A document from Murray Mitchell, the director of the FIC, listed 72 suspicious transaction reports implicating members of the Gupta family and their companies, some of which comprised multiple entries for which no amount was listed. He did not specify why the transactions were considered suspect.Gordhan asked the banks to provide confidential reports made to the FIC in an open court, detailing suspicious transactions, to determine if there was any substance to Oakbay s claim that the banks acted improperly.On Friday, Oakbay said Gordhan s reliance on the list of 72 purported suspicious transaction reports is misplaced and the minister s application is supported by a flawed analysis and a faulty factual record .The statement added Oakbay has never suggested that the minister is required to intervene in the bank-customer relationship. There is no contested legal issue here and there is never any reason for the minister to bring this application.

Instead, he has asked the court to confirm that he does not have to do anything. It adds Gordhan has asked the court to insert itself into the functioning of the executive branch. It would be bizarre if every empowered government official receiving a request for assistance or counsel races to court to seek a declaration that he/she does not have to act on the request.

Two-thirds of the allegedly suspicious transactions occurred after the time when the banks had already decided to terminate their relationship with Oakbay, it adds.Oakbay also says the Financial Intelligence Centre s release of the information was unlawful and, as a result of its arguments, the court should decline the relief and dismiss Gordhan s application with costs. Furthermore, the timing of the Minister s application supports the Oakbay Group s suspicions that the application is politically motivated and is part of the minister s ongoing plan to diminish the Oakbay Group and the Gupta family and to damage their hard-earned South African business.
