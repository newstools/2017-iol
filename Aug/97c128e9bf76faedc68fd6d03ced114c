London - Most new dog owners are familiar with the furniture chewing phase. But when Neil Kemp came downstairs one morning, he was greeted with something a little more dramatic. All he could do was laugh at the sight of his five-month-old British bulldog Rocco standing nervously in a snow storm of polystyrene balls after having torn up a beanbag. Neil, 35, of Tredegar in south Wales, said: "I stood there for five minutes just looking at him and then started filming. I didn’t know what to say, I just burst out laughing." He added that it took three or four hours to clean up – and about 25 changes of the vacuum cleaner bag.   Daily Mail
