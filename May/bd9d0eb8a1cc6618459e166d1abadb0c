Parliament - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has accused her department officials in district offices of selling teacher posts and hiding behind "feared giant‚Äù the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu).  Speaking to the media before presenting her budget vote in Parliament, Motshekga said there was no evidence pointing to Sadtu in the cases she had dealt with.  The department commissioned an investigation by Dr John Volmink into the sale of teacher posts in the department across the country. Sadtu was fingered in the report.  Responding to a question, Motshekga said a year into implementing the Volmink report, her department was being forced to come back to what Sadtu maintained all along that it never sanctioned the practice of selling posts.  "There is no evidence in the cases I have dealt with," she said to media question. "What came in the report, this is what Dr Volmink kept explaining, is in the interviews some of the teachers alleged that Sadtu was responsible for the sale of posts," she said.  "Of all the cases I dealt with, not a one single points to Sadtu."  Motshekga also said the practise of selling of posts was continuing in some provinces such as in KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo.  Motshekga said district officials were selling the posts hiding behind blaming Sadtu.  "The district officials are continuing with their shenanigans in the appointment of teachers," she said.  "In the main, it is our district officials that are responsible for the problems," Motshekga said.  She insisted that in the cases she has dealt with, "none have to do with Sadtu". Political Bureau
