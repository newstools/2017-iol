Thaba ‘Nchu, Free State - The 2017 RFS Auto Bike Econorun, run over two days across a chilly Free State at the weekend, became something of an endurance test as well as a trial of throttle control and riding skill, as wind, potholes and unfamiliar territory tested the mettle of the contestants.
 
And lest you think the Econorun is an old fart’s doddle, remember that each section has to be completed in a given time, usually equivalent to an average of about 80 percent of the speed limit - and for every minute that you’re late, a penalty of half a litre gets added to your actual fuel usage.
 
But that doesn’t allow for such things as weather or heavy traffic; for instance, a target speed of 100km/h on the N1 sounds like a walk in the park, and early on a Sunday morning it probably would be. Mid-morning on a busy Friday, however, it requires nerves of steel and a total disregard for personal safety!
 Real-world conditions Unsurprisingly, the overall winner was the smallest bike in the field, a sporty little 150cc Yamaha R15, ridden with commendable alacrity by Gareth Floweday, who used a grand total of 22.651 litres of petrol to ride 899km - that’s 2.519 litres per 100km in very real-world conditions - on a wide variety roads, incurring not a single penalty along the way.
 
Second was experienced Econorunner Denver Biggs, on another Class A lightweight - a BMW G310 - who recorded 3.151 litres per 100km. But the biggest surprise of the 2017 Econorun - and the biggest winner - was rookie Eleanore Grobler from Pretoria, who finished third overall with 3.328 litres per 100km on her BMW F800S sports-tourer.
 
In addition to the trophy for third place, she won Class C for twin-cylinder machines from 501-800cc and also took home the awards for Top Lady and Top Rookie. Respect.
