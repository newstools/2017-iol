Holiday packages  were selling like hot cakes at the Travel Expo in Johannesburg last weekend . Now in it's sixth year, 120 exhibitors from top airlines and travel agencies saw interacted with more than 20 000  who visited the  Ticketpro Dome in search of the perfect destination. The MD of Flight Centre Andrew Stark said he was very happy with the turnout. "We are now six years in the running and I think the expo has become synonymous with joburgers  like boerewors in South Africa,"Stark said. More than three hundred people rushed in a few minutes after the doors were opened for the two day exhibition. Last year they had over 18 000 people attending the expo. The number grew to over 20 000 last weekend. India, Clubmed and GAdventure were among the exhibitor with big stands that attracted curious globe trotters. Southern Africa destinations like Victoria Falls, Zanzibar, Namibia and Mozambique are still hot flavors. Destinations  like Thailand were going for as low as R9400 for 7 nights.  Bali was went for under R 10 000 while and all inclusive to Mauritius went for under R10 000. " Bali and Zanzibar were the hot favourites because they are fairly new to the South African market." From East Africa, Nairobi Kenya is fast becoming an enticing destination for corporate travellers. "Kenya is picking up as a business hub. Nigeria used to be a flavour of the conversation 10 years ago but these days I am hearing more of Nairobi," Stark reiterated. The father of three  has been to over 39 destinations  but he still  vouches by Mauritius for a good family holiday. "For December I prefer staying locally but  I am a big fan of Mauritius because I have three kids. Mauritius is easy. You don't have to drive anywhere. You have got a beautiful beach and childminders. It's also not far to travel with kids," he added. Skiing also seemed to be quite popular for older couples with no young kids.
