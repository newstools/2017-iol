JOHANNESBURG – Platinum Stars coach Roger de Sa was subjected to contrasting emotions when his men registered their first victory of the season on Wednesday night. Dikwena halted their winless streak in the Absa Premiership courtesy of Vuyo Mere’s strike, which garnered De Sa’s troops a massive win over Ajax Cape Town at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace. De Sa was elated and frustrated at the same time. Though he was delighted with maximum points, the same can’t be said about the performances of his charges. “It’s good to get the monkey off your back. First of all, it is nice that a win is there now. It puts us in touch with the teams that are above us. “Now we’ve got to get going. I think it’s now four games without a loss – hopefully we keep that consistency. It’s good for us. We have just to keep going now,” said De Sa. “Last night’s performance was the worst performance since I have been here, and we go and win. Football is crazy. It’s the way it goes. “They hit the crossbar and Dino Visser made a world-class save towards the end. We also missed. We should have killed the game. It’s a three vital points and a very tough game. We are very relieved.” De Sa is hoping that his men will continue winning when they host Bloemfontein Celtic in the Telkom Knockout quarter-finals at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace on Saturday.
