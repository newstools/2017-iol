Ajax Cape Town’s problems over the last few seasons have been rooted in the team’s inability to perform well on the road. While they have managed to find a measure of consistency at home, the moment they are taken out of their comfort zone, things go awry. It’s an issue uppermost in the mind of Ajax head coach Stanley Menzo – and he’s hoping to change the team’s fortunes away from home when they take on Polokwane City in the opening round of the Telkom Knockout Cup at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday afternoon (3.30pm kickoff). The last time Ajax travelled to Limpopo, they decided to change their routine. They flew up earlier than usual, got on the bus for the long journey, and then had their final training session in the city of Polokwane. Menzo believes that’s the best way to tackle the difficult trip – and that’s the way they will do it this time too. “We have struggled when we play away, when we have to travel, but it has to change,” said Menzo at a press conference at the club’s training ground in Parow on Thursday. “We have to turn it around on the road, otherwise why bother to go there. We have to bring the belief that we can win on the road. “It’s in the psychology – it’s what’s in the players’ heads. “Often on away trips, in terms of preparation, it’s the small changes that matter. “The last time we had a training session in Polokwane a day before the game, it worked better… so that’s how we will do it again.” @Reinerss11  IOL Sport Like IOL Sport on Facebook
