Johannesburg The price of all grades of petrol will increase by 67c/l with effect from midnight on September 5, the energy department said on Sunday. The price of diesel, both 0.05 percent sulphur and 0.005 percent sulphur, would increase by 44.00c/l, the department said in a statement. The wholesale price of illuminating paraffin would increase by 49c per litre, and the single maximum national retail price (SMNRP) by 65c per litre. The maximum LP Gas retail price would increase by 86c per kilogram. The department said the main reasons for the fuel price adjustments were that the rand depreciated, on average, against the US dollar during the period under review, and that the international prices of petroleum products increased on average during the same time.
