Essien, who also spent a season with Real Madrid, departed Chelsea for AC Milan in the 2013/14 season and after two years in Italy, spent a single season with Greek giants Panathinaikos. The former Lyon (France) midfielder made 256 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea and won two league titles, four FA Cups and the Champions League during an eight-and-a-half-year spell in west London. The 34-year-old has been without a team since being released by Panathinaikos at the end of last season and according to Cape Town City boss John Comitis was offered to his club as a free agent. While the Cape side would not have had to pay a transfer fee, it's likely that Essien would have commanded a hefty salary; certainly by PSL standards. Having taken all factors into account, a decision was made by the club not to sign the Ghanaian. "We were offered Essien and we did look at the deal quite closely, with regards to what he could bring to our current squad, but in the end, we decided against it," Comitis told TimesLive. "Once we weighed up everything, it was just not the right move for us." The newly-formed team have confirmed four signings in the just-closed January transfer window: Letsi Koapeng (former Orlando Pirates striker, signed from Stellenbosch FC), Siyabonga Dubula (midfielder, FC Cape Town), Raphael Georgiades (defender, promoted from youth team), and Mozambique international defender, Edmilson Dove. Comitis says however that there may still be some additional arrivals. "We still have two foreign slots open and there are a lot of quality free agents out there. We will look at them and what they can bring to the squad, and if it works for both parties then we will sign them," he said. City are joint top of the PSL standings and won their first trophy, the Telkom Knockout after beating SuperSport United 2-1 in December African News Agency
