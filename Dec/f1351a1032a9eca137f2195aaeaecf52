Shannen Rustin, in Grade 11, was among a group of 15 pupils from the Rondebosch school who travelled to a schools World Challenge expedition in Hanoi, Vietnam.  School principal Rob le Roux confirmed the news on Friday evening.  The school wrote on its website that the pupils had conquered “extreme heat and humidity” during a trek in Sapa Valley.  Asked whether Shannen’s death was related to the heat, Le Roux said he did not have all the details available and that history teacher Gordon Brookbanks, who is on the expedition with the pupils, would give further information during the weekend. “I’m not being vague, I don’t have further information. I’ve spoken to the parents. The family is on the way to 
Vietnam.”  He said he had communicated with the parents of the other 14 pupils. “As far as I know (the expedition) continues. Mr Brookbanks will notify us about whether we’re pulling out or not.”  In the letter written to the parents on Friday, he said: “Unfortunately I have to pass on to you some very tragic news coming from Mr Brookbanks and our history tourists in Vietnam. “Whilst on a cycle outing in Hoi An and after a short photo stop, Shannen Rustin collapsed, was rushed to hospital where doctors worked on her for hours, but were unable to revive her and unfortunately she passed away.  “I have been in touch with Mr Paul Rustin and through the travel agent have managed to secure flights for Mrs Rustin and her son to fly over today at midday.” Weekend Argus
