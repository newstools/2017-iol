“Mani Ratnam sir is a dear friend and, most importantly, a great director. The magic that was created 15 years ago with Roja, I wish to do the same in the near future,” Madhoo says. Madhoo shared screen space with Arvind Swamy in Roja, which received wide acclamation mainly for its songs by Oscar winner AR Rahman. Madhoo will next be seen as Queen Sambhavija in the popular Star Plus show Aarambh. “This character has so many layers to it that I am already in awe of her. The character is very strong and powerful and I couldn't have asked for a better role to make my TV debut,” Madhoo said.
