Ed Westwick has been accused of sexual assault by a third woman, despite slamming the claims of his previous two accusers. The 'Gossip Girl' actor was accused this month by two women, Kristina Cohen and Aurélie Wynn, of historic counts of sexual assault dating back to 2014, and though he has since denied the allegations, a third woman has claimed she too was a victim of Ed's alleged misconduct. Rachel Eck was at a party with Ed three years ago, where she claims he would "try to kiss me or kind of push me up against the wall", and although she "pushed him off" each time, she alleges "it got worse and he got more handsy" as the night wore on. After his unwanted advances, Rachel claims she threatened to leave the party, but her ex-boyfriend Kaine Harling convinced her to stay and told her Ed wanted to apologise for his behaviour. Speaking to Buzzfeed News, Rachel said: "Ed then pulled me onto the bed and aggressively groped me. I shoved him off as quickly as I could and left. I have never felt so uncomfortable in a situation like that in my entire life." Earlier this month, Kristina Cohen was the first woman to accuse Ed, 30, of sexual assault, when she claimed the star had "held [her] down and raped [her]" after she fell asleep in a bedroom in his house. Kristina's allegations then prompted a second claim from Aurélie Wynn, who alleged that a "similar" ordeal happened to her when she visited Ed's home with her boyfriend at the time, Mark Salling. However, Ed recently took to social media to slam the allegations against him as "provably untrue", and insisted he would never do anything so "vile and horrific". He wrote: "It is disheartening and sad to me that as a result of two unverified and provably untrue social media claims, there are some in this environment who could ever conclude I have had anything to do with such vile and horrific conduct. "I have absolutely not, and am cooperating with the authorities so that they can clear my name as soon as possible."
