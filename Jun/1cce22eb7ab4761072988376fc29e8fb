SACRAMENTO, California – American Blake Leeper broke South African Oscar Pistorius’ T43 Paralympic world record in the 400 metres when he ran 45.25 seconds at the US athletics championships on Friday, officials said. “It is hard to believe. To run 45.25 to break the world record, I am excited for the future,” said the 27-year-old Tennessee native, who lives in southern California. Leeper finished a non-advancing seventh in the semi-final race despite competing as a double amputee. Pistorius set his record of 45.39 at Daegu, South Korea in August, 2011. Paralympic gold medallist Pistorius is serving a six-year jail term after being found guilty of murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, at his luxury Pretoria home on Valentine’s Day in 2013. The 30-year-old Pistorius has six Paralympic gold medals and took part in the 2012 London Olympics as the first amputee runner to do so. He was hoping to make a comeback after initially being found guilty of culpable homicide in 2015, but that is unlikely now for the South African sprinter after he was instead convicted of murder last year.
