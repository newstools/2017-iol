Five FM presenter and Generations: The Legacy actress Thando Thabethe is making waves in the South African entertainment scene. The 26-year-old recently stunned on the cover of Bona magazine where she wore a white dress. This is her favourite place.  Where do you stay? Fourways. What do you buy? Bags at Forever New. Any must visit spots? If you have never been to Vilakazi Street in Soweto, then I suggest you do so. It is a must see and you will learn a lot. What is your favourite view? I love hiking and the views from the top are amazing. I recently went to the Walter Sisulu Botanical Garden hiking trail, which had out of this world views. What do you do on a free afternoon? Sit on my couch, either watching television or reading. Best place for cocktails? Â I love Hyde Park Corner or the Goliath Comedy club in Melrose.
