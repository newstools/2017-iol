Johannesburg - The DA on Monday said it would investigate claims around Police Minister Fikile Mbalula's R680 000 family trip to Dubai. Mbalula came under scrutiny after reports emerged that the South AfricanÂ Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) and Team SA clothing supplier allegedly bankrolled a trip he took with his family to Dubai over the New Year's period. Mbalula was the sports and recreation minister at the time. According to EWN, Mbalula's family trip was allegedly funded by Sedgers Sport, with the initial R300 000 being paid by a company linked to them - Reimon Uniforms- and the remainder being paid by a Sedgers employee. Mbalula reportedly refused to confirm or deny the allegations, telling EWN that there was nothing untoward about the trip and who paid for it. He then accused the news outlet of invading his privacy. Sedgers also denied paying for the Mbalula''s trip to Dubai. Sascoc has since distanced itself from the matter, saying it was a matter between Sedgers and the former sports minister. This despite the fact that one of their suppliers is implicated in the matter. The DA shadow minister for sports and recreation Tsepo Mhlongo meanwhile, has confirmed that the party would probe the trip. "I'll be writing formal questions on the trip because the minister cannot claim the matter is private when R680K was spent on the trip," he said. "We'll also question how many people went on the trip, why it wasn't declared and whether or not it was subsidised." Mhlongo also confirmed that the trip had not been declared, adding that Mbalula ought to have declared it, even if it had been a donation. IOL
