Johannesburg – Kia has added seven more derivatives to its new Kia Sportage line-up, launched in South Africa late in 2016, bringing the total to 12. The entry-level Sportage 2.0 Ignite, which was launched with manual gearbox only, is now also available with a six-speed automatic transmission, for a few dollars more (well, R13 000 more, to be exact). The next step up is the Ignite Plus trim level, adding front foglights and an electrochromatic rear view mirror to the base spec, with 17 inch alloys in place of the Ignite’s sixteens. It’s also the first Sportage with a 1.7-litre CRDI turbodiesel, rated for 85kW at 4000 revs and 280Nm from 1250-2750rpm, mated to a six-speed manual ‘box. The Ignite Plus is also offered with Kia’s familiar 114kW/192Nm two-litre petrol four, in your choice of six-speed manual or automatic transmission. The mid-range EX trim level, previously only in two-litre CRDI turbodiesel, six-speed auto format, now includes a two-litre petrol option, also with automatic transmission, and the upspecced EX Plus trim, adding power-adjustable front seats, an 18cm touchscreen with built-in satnav, a rear-view camera and 19 inch alloy rims. The range-topping SX models and 1.6-litre turbopetrol GT Line remain unchanged, as does the Sportage’s five-year, unlimited distance warranty and five-year or 90 000km service plan.
