Respected psychiatrist Dr Sean Baumann’s rousing cantata Madness: Songs of Hope and Despair, returns to the Baxter Theatre for a limited season from 9 to 19 February, with two Sunday performances at 6pm. Baumann’s libretto is brought to life through music composed by Galina Juritz with Dizu Plaatjies, conducted by Chad Hendricks and directed by Lara Foot. Fiona Moodie integrates her own artworks with that of work by patients of Valkenberg Hospital, with video design by Koeka Stander and lighting design by Patrick Curtis.  Mental illness and psychotic experiences are brought into the spotlight using a combination of rousing music (both live and some recorded), song and striking visual imagery in an attempt to portray the complexities and also the wonder of these strange and ultimately unknowable worlds. The project arose from a concern that the plight of the seriously mentally ill is either ignored or profoundly misunderstood and that this contributes significantly to the suffering of those deemed insane.
