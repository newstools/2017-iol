UAC’s chief executive, Larry Ettah, said on Friday that its partnership with 
the food company was paying dividends and that in recent conversations the South African firm had said 
Nigeria remained important 
as it looked to expand abroad. Tiger bought 49 percent of UAC’s food business in 2010 but since then it has had to sell its 65.7 percent stake in its loss-making Nigerian flour division for $1 to Dangote Industries, owned by Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, having bought it for $200 million in 2012.

No one at Tiger was immediately available for comment. Reuters
