Cape Town - Outspoken ANC MP Makhosi Khoza has been charged with ill-discipline by the KwaZulu-Natal ANC. ANC KZN provincial secretary Supra Zuma said Khoza was charged on Tuesday and will be appearing before a disciplinary hearing. Khoza has confirmed that she has received the charge sheet, but says she will not be commenting further. The ANC MP has been very critical of President Jacob Zuma's leadership and even asked that he step down. She has claimed that she's received multiple threats to her life over past couple of months for her comments against Zuma. Khoza's charging was for weeks rumoured to be on the cards after numerous ANC members criticised her for her comments calling for Zuma to step down. "She has been charged and she will have to appear before a disciplinary hearing. At this point in time we don't believe that we should engage  publicly on this matter as it is now in a formal matter that needs to be dealt with by disciplinary committee," Supra Zuma. Politics Hub
