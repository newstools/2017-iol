There is nothing like being on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean. While you sip sundowners on the pool deck, here are some tips that you can use to better your experience: Plan your cruise excursions in advance Cruise ships offers some of the best on board entertainment, but if you are not fast to book your seats, you will be left disappointed. Make sure you familiarise yourself with the programme so you and those with you can plan which ones best suits you and your time schedule. When you board, you can make all the necessary arrangements to secure your seat. Carry your own medical supplies Getting sick on board is highly likely so it's important to carry the necessary medication in your bags. From sunscreen, motion sickness tablets, allergy or constipation/diarrhea medication, you should stock them all. Chances are you will be paying huge amounts of money at the cruise ship shop than you would at home for medication. Say no to the mini fridge People love their alcohol on cruise ships so it will be tempting for them to enjoy the bar fridge facilities. Try to stock up on some snacks before boarding and if you consuming alcohol, try purchasing it at the shipâ€™s shop or bar. It is definitely cheaper than the prices set for the mini bar fridge. Go big or go home
 
If you can spare a few extra rands for a suite, I suggest you do. The bathrooms are more comfy than normal ones and there is more room to enjoy the views. Try to relax Of the reasons I enjoy cruises is for the relaxation. Many people get drunk, causing huge hangovers the next morning. Try to minimise on your drinking and spend more time relaxing. A drink or two is fine, but overdoing this could have ramifications for your wellbeing.
