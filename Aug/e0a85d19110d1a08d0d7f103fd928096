Johannesburg - A mall robbery in east Johannesburg has led to the arrest of a 33-year-old man in connection with a shooting at Hillbrow Theatre that left one dead and eight others injured, police said on Monday. Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the man was linked to the Sunday shooting and was under police guard at Tembisa Hospital. "He was arrested at the Greenstone Mall where a group of five suspects robbed a business yesterday [Sunday morning]. Police and mall security chased the suspects as they were fleeing after the robbery. Four others managed to escape, he sustained injuries during [his] arrest and was taken to the hospital under police guard." The man faces charges of murder, attempted murder, armed robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm. Gauteng police had launched a manhunt for the shooter after he opened fire at revellers during a music concert at Hillbrow Theatre early on Sunday. Police said he jumped onto the stage while a band was performing and grabbed a microphone and claimed that he would stop the band unless he got back his stolen cellphone. The audience protested and he fired several shots randomly before fleeing on foot. The deceased was identified as 26-year-old Allan Percy Ndlovu, a Zimbabwean national. Eleven cartridges from a 9mm firearm were found at the scene. African News Agency
