The couple tied the knot in a fairy tale wedding ceremony in 2014. Last year Janine shared this heartfelt message on Facebook as she announced the pregnancy. “Everyone, I am going to become a mommy to a beautiful little princess!!!!! Except for my wedding day, it was the best day of my life when I heard. I am soooo happy the news has finally been broken, and soooo grateful for every beautiful wish. Her name is Romy-Lee (named after my mother) and I can’t wait to start shopping. “Wow, I am so excited today, there is still a very painful part deep in my heart. I wish I could give a firm hug today to every woman who still hopes and tries, and even to those who can never have children. Because I know the hell you are going through." IOL
