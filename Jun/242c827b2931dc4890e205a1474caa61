 The fire came on the back of a massive storm that hit Cape Town on Tuesday at around 11pm and saw hundreds displaced, at least eight people dead as well as schools and some universities closed as a result. Nel-Peters, with the backing of Sun International and Cell C, launched the fund for those who have lost everything in the recent devastating fires along the Garden Route. Nel-Peters, who grew up in Sedgefield, which is part of the affected area, expressed delight at the positive response from South Africans. “I thank all South Africans for giving so generously. Every bit helps and I am proud of how ordinary people have rallied around and assisted those who have been affected. I urge people to continue with donations, no matter how small.” All monies collected will be used by the Sedgefield Lions to buy much needed supplies, including items such as water, tinned food, baby food, bread, blankets, toiletries and pet food. These will be distributed across the Garden Route to those most in need.
