Travellers interested in stars and astronomy, here is an event for you. National Zoological Gardens and the Pretoria Branch of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa will host an evening of stargazing on Saturday, May 27, at the Pretoria Zoo. There is no charge for the event, but booking is essential. The stargazing event will also be a great platform for local and international tourists to socialise through a bring and braai after the event. However, please bring your own camping chairs, folding tables, picnic baskets, cutlery, crockery, food and drinks for an evening of facts and fun.  A number of telescopes will be put up by members of the Astronomical Society through which our guests can experience planets and stars, constellations and clusters, galaxies and nebulae. The event begins at 5pm with the moonset expected at 7.21pm. The Percy Jacobs of the Astronomical Society will give a practical overview of the night sky at 18:00, using a laser pointer to indicate important objects.
