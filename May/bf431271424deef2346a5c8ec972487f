Nurburg, Germany – Even more deeply embedded than the rivalry between Audi and Porsche, is that between the petrolheads at AMG in Affalterbach and the performance junkies at BMW’s M skunk works in Munich. Never one to let an opportunity go by to take a dig at his rival, M’s Frank van Meel congratulated AMG on the official celebration of its 50th anniversary at the weekend’s Nurburgring 24 Hours – his tongue firmly in his cheek – with this huge poster on the side of the M trackside boma at the ‘Ring, showing what looks like an M2 shredding tyres on tarmac. The message reads: “You ordered cake, we made donuts. M congratulates AMG on its 50th anniversary” We can’t wait for AMG’s reply.     IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
