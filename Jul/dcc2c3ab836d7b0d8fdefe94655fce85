Cape Town - Insurance company Miway says it can "categorically confirm" that a picture of an email speaking about "punishing black baboons" is fake. In a Facebook post on Thursday the short-term insurer said it "has investigated the origins of a snap shot of a supposed email sent from a MiWay employee, circulating on social media. MiWay can categorically confirm that the email is fake". The company's response comes after a picture was posted on Twitter on Thursday showing an email purportedly sent by a Miway employee. The email reads: "This is a reminder of yesterdays managers meeting. The final decisions was to reject 90% of claims made by black people as from 1 August 2017. They are an easy target, its also a great opportunity t ave money and punish those black baboons."    In a Facebook post on Thursday MiWay CEO René Otto said: “MiWay is a proudly South African company committed to diversity and transparency. We have been made aware of a racist email purported to have been written and sent by a member of staff. An urgent investigation was launched and we can confirm that the email with its content was never sent from a MiWay employee. "There was also no such meeting that took place or decision to this effect. We are tracing the source of this fake content on social media and will take strong and appropriate action against anyone using our brand to disseminate offensive and derogatory comments.”   IOL  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
