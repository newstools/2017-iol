The maker says this hybrid addition to the McLaren Ultimate Series product family – currently under development in the McLaren Special Operations skunk works – will be the the most powerful and most aerodynamic road-going McLaren yet. Just 106 will be made, the same number as were built of the F1 (and they’re all pre-sold!), not in the production shop but one at a time in the MSO bespoke division, with each owner working alongside the staff to choose colours, trim materials and other personal detailing for his or her own car. It’s a painstaking process; the first cars are not expected to be delivered until sometime in 2019, but there are evidently 106 (very wealthy) McLaren enthusiasts out there who think it will be worth the wait. And the name? This is MSO’s second Bespoke Project, and it has three seats. Logical, as the late Leonard Nimoy would have said. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
