The demonstrators, carrying placards reading "Enough is Enough", sang songs as they walked to the spot where 21-year-old Sandlana’s half-naked body was found on September 3 in TR Section, Lingelethu West. Face down, she wore a bra and one shoe and a bottle was stuffed in her mouth. Her body was partially burnt. One of the marchers, Karabo Monatisi, said all murders and rapes should be treated as high profile and police should investigate cases thoroughly to bring those responsible to book. “Cases of women abuse are increasing and getting out of control in Khayelitsha more than anywhere else,” he said. Monatisi said police instructing Sandlana’s family not to speak to the media was uncalled for and aimed at relieving the pressure they were receiving from media on progress in the case. He said talking to friends and family about women and children abuse was not enough. “Let’s go to the taverns and speak there, educate our brothers,” Monatisi said. Aviwe Peko said: “It is horrifying how our communities are turning to be the hubs of such crimes. "Where exactly are people supposed live safely and not be fearful of such killings? What men do to women is evil." No arrests have been made. Cape Times
