Cucumber slices placed on a woman’s eyes is one of the most common beauty spa images you will find on the internet — have you ever wondered why?
I used to think it went hand in hand with a facial and that’s how it’s meant to be done. Well ladies, the cucumber slices aren’t decorative. They are one of the many quick fixes to reduce puffiness around the eyes. Waking up with puffy eyes makes you look even more tired than you most likely are. Late nights or lack of sleep will do that to you and no amount of concealer can cover that up. Using the popular cucumber slices trick is one of many quick fixes to reduce puffiness. Here are other tricks to try that do the job equally well: Tea bags: Don’t throw away your used teabags. Especially green tea ones. The antioxidants and caffeine in the tea can help tighten the skin. Moisten them in a bowl of ice water. Then place them over your eyes for 20 minutes. Ice water: A few splashes of ice cold water on your face is a sure way to wake you up. Splashing your face with cold water (as cold as you can tolerate) is a quick and easy way to reduce swelling. Or you can end your shower routine with a quick burst of cold water. If you have more time, soak a cloth in ice water and place it over your eyes for 10 minutes. Spoons: If you are prone to waking up with puffy eyes or you get home after a night of partying and drinks, place two spoons in the fridge before you go to bed. The next morning place the spoons over your eyes. Massage: Gently massage around the eye area to increase circulation in the area. Don’t rub too hard because it is a sensitive area.
