Last night’s bachelor was Thabiso Banda, an "IT specialist","production coordinator" and a "millionaire in the making", from Mondeor, South of Joburg. Thabiso said he was looking for a gorgeous and ambitious woman. "I want a confident girl. I can not stand ignorant girls...that would be a deal breaker," he said The first potential date was Refiloe, a radio producer who was looking for a gentleman “who “knows his story” "I want an organised guy, he must know his story," she said. The second lady was Thando, a travel consultant, who is not " too picky". "I am not picky, I just want a clean guy who dresses well." The final hopeful was Mpho, a PHD student, who was looking for a guy who is "employed". "He must be employed, I want someone who knows what he wants," said Mpho. The dates with the three families didn't go too well as Thabiso kept on dodging questions.   Family: You're in IT, what exactly do u do in IT? Thabiso: I'm abitious, I'm versatile, I do a lot of things.HE'S DODGY AF 😂 #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/vnOOCNuvtK     At the end, Thabiso chose Thando and duo seemed to like each other. They even shared a kiss. This guy doesn't waste anytime hey.  While some were impressed by Mpho's studies and career goals, others started to questions Thabiso's chose.
