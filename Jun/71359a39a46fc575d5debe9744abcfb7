Johannesburg – Popular radio station 947 on Monday announced a change to its mid-morning lineup following the departure of Stacey Norman. Norman, host of the Stacey Norman Live show broadcast on weekdays from 10am to 1pm, is set to leave the 947 after having been with Primedia for 11 years. Coming in as Norman's replacement is former YFM DJ, Ayanda MVP, who will host the mid-morning show from July 3. Speaking of Norman's departure was 947 station manager Ravi Naidoo, who hailed Norman for her contribution to the company.   “Stacey has grown up with Primedia Broadcasting; she’s taken the platform, built her personal brand and is now a nationally recognised media figure, co-hosting a prime-time TV show: The Voice," Naidoo said. “We are proud to have been a part of her journey and know that she has exciting things in the pipeline – we will be following her successes and wish her the very best for her next chapter.”  Speaking of her new slot, Ayanda said she was excited to take over the mid-morning slot from Norman. Ayanda joined the station earlier this year and hosts the Saturday afternoon show.  “I’m extremely excited about this new change. I’ve listened to 947 from an early age and now to be given the show that was hosted by one of my role model’s is a dream come true,” says Ayanda. “I’ve looked up to Stacey and Anele and now I will be in that same light with people looking up to me. There are a lot of young ladies that can, through my journey, see that dreams DO come true and I feel so blessed. Molifeng – this means anything is possible.” IOL
