Cape Town - President Jacob Zuma on Thursday categorically denied that he received any payments from private individuals and companies since he assumed power in 2009, drawing heckling from opposition benches. "I did not receive any payments from private individuals or companies during my tenure as President of the Republic of South Africa other than those disclosed or reported to the necessary authorities," Zuma said in his last question-and-answer session for the year in the National Assembly. Zuma was responding to a question from Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane who asked the president about claims in veteran journalist Jacque Pauw's new book "The President's Keepers" that Zuma was on the payroll of Royal Security and received a salary of R1 million in the first months of his presidency. Maimane tried to push Zuma, saying: "With all sincerity we don't believe you." Zuma would not budge, hinting that the claims in the book were mere rumours. "I have given a very categoric answer to the question and secondly there are many books that have talked about Jacob Zuma in this country and saying all speculations and rumours, etc. I don't think my job is to answer books. I've given the answer." African News Agency
