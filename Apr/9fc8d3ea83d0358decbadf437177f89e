Chris Pratt doesn't take selfies with fans because he thinks his time could be better spent elsewhere.  The 'Guardians of the Galaxy' actor – who has four-year-old son Jack with his 'House Bunny' actress wife Anna Faris – has admitted he doesn't like to take photos with people on the streets because he has to be more "economical with [his] time". The 37-year-old hunk says he has learnt over the years how to be "comfortable disappointing people".

But now I have to be economical with my time. If I go out and want to do normal things, I have to be comfortable disappointing people. So I just don't take pictures with people. Because that's not about enjoying the moment; it's about stealing the moment to brag about later. So I say, 'Would you settle for a handshake?' And then they take the picture anyway." Chris looks back fondly on a time when he was able to chat to people he doesn't know who have no preconceptions about him.

What I really miss is sitting down and talking to strangers who don't know me, so we can discover each other. I'd say the majority of people I meet have an idea about me before they meet me. There's something nice to being able to surprise somebody."
