The Wolftrap Steakhouse Championship is hunting down South Africa's greatest steakhouse to find the national champion for 2017.
The first round has been completed. This was a public voting phase to identify South Africa’s favourite steakhouses, and the 10 who received the most votes made it through to the judging round.
The 2017 awards ceremony will take place on July 18 at the current Steakhouse Champion, The Local Grill in Parktown North, Johannesburg. 
In addition to awards for the top ten steakhouses and the trophy for The Wolftrap Steakhouse Champion for 2017, this year there will be further special awards, including Newcomer of the Year, Chain Steakhouse of the Year and Steakhouse Legend of the Year.
