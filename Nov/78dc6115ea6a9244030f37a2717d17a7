Sliced on to a piece of toast, cubed into a salad or mashed up for guacamole, this creamy fruit has gained popularity over the past few years. So much so that you’ll even find it in desserts! This wonder fruit isn’t just good to eat, though. It even has its uses as a beauty treatment. Here are a few reasons why an avo should be part of your beauty routine and how to use it. For shiny hair, make a hair mask by mashing a ripe avo and mixing it with coconut or olive oil, an egg yolk and a teaspoon of honey.Apply the mixture to your hair. Rinse after 20 minutes. Nourish dry skin with a simple avocado-and-yoghurt face mask. Mix mashed up avo with a tablespoon of plain yoghurt and a teaspoon of honey.Apply the paste with your fingers and leave on for about 15 minutes. Rinse with lukewarm water. Ease pain and redness caused by sunburn by applying a thin layer of mashed avo to the affected area. You can use avocado oil as well. Exfoliate and moisturise dry hands by rubbing in a mixture of mashed avocado and brown sugar. Leave on for five minutes then rinse hands. Do not use soap. The mixture removes dead skin cells and nourishes the skin.
