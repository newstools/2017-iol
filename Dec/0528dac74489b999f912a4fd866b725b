Prior Design of Germany has treated Mercedes X-Class fans to a new range of accessories, including a widebody exterior design kit. In addition to widened wheel arches, buyers can opt for a bolder AMG-inspired front bumper, a more prominent rear bumper and a range of alloy wheel designs up to 23-inches in diameter. With various suspension kits on offer and different tyre options, customers can go for the ground-hugging low-rider effect or opt for a more rugged package with off-road tyres and raised suspension. A Prior Design exhaust system is also available on request, although there is no mention of any engine mods. It’s only a matter of time before the tuning companies jump on that bandwagon though. The company mentions an Exclusive Custom Interior that’s available to order, although no pictures or further information was provided on that topic. The Navara-based X-Class double cab bakkie is set to arrive in South Africa in April 2018, with initial versions powered by Nissan’s 140kW/450Nm 2.3-litre twin-turbo-diesel engine, with a range-topping 190kW/550Nm version featuring Merc’s own 3-litre oil burner scheduled to arrive later in the year.
