Detroit, Michigan - Jeep has had to walk a tightrope with its new-generation Wrangler, keeping up with modern comfort and efficiency requirements while retaining the basic flavour and capability of the outgoing model. That’s no easy task, but Jeep certainly appears to have stuck to the Wrangler’s roots with the 2018 model that you see here. Only three pictures have been released thus far, along with very limited information, but Jeep promises to spill all the beans at the Los Angeles Motor Show on November 29. Although Jeep is referring to it as “all-new” we’ll have to wait until the end of the month to find out just how different it is beneath the skin. All Jeep is saying for now is that is that it has “advanced" and "fuel-efficient” engines, and that it’s “loaded with more safety features and advanced technology than ever before.” Purists will however appreciate that the doors are still removable and the windscreen still folds down, and Jeep is promising even better off-road ability. The styling, as you can see here, also stays true to the Wrangler's roots, but there are a few notable differences, like headlights that push into the ‘keystone’ grille, and additional lights integrated into the wheel arches. And yet perhaps the most exciting news for South Africans is that there will also be a bakkie version this time around. Stay tuned. IOL Motoring
