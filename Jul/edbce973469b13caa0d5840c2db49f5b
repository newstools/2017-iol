Jennifer Lopez has gushed about boyfriend Alex Rodriguez in a sweet birthday post on social media, in which she admitted her heart "skips a beat" whenever she sees her beau. The 48-year-old singer has taken to social media to celebrate her beau, who turned 42 on July 27, by sharing a heartfelt message about the former New York Yankees baseball player. Alongside a photograph of the sportsman looking dapper in a sleek tailored suit, which Jennifer shared on her personal Instagram account, wrote: "Happy Birthday to the man who makes my heart skip a beat every time he walks in the room...

Her post continued: "Wishing you the best year ever my love...so excited for everything God has in store for you... #thebestisyettocome#itsyourday #mimacho #amormio #happybirthday #LEO #13 (sic)."

And to mark the couple's special days they shared a joint birthday party over the weekend, which was extended to Monday (24.07.17) for Jennifer, who enjoyed a more intimate bash in her garden. The star was given a three-tiered birthday cake, which was decorated with white and gold-coloured icing, edible gold-painted roses and two sparklers, from Alex and his two daughters Ella, nine, and Natasha, 12. In a crowded room but it's just the two of you. #birthdaylaughs #insidejokesallday #team #US üì∏: @lacarba A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Jul 24, 2017 at 7:37am PDT Jennifer and Alex are no strangers to publicly showing their love for one another, as the vocalist previously praised her beau as a "beautiful person".
