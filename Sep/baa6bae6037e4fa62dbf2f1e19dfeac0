Rejection in the bedroom leads to a broad range of responses, and a recent survey has uncovered the most likely reactions of men who are faced with tantalising temptations in the bedroom. The survey, conducted by VictoriaMilan, took a look behind the closed bedroom doors of 9 507 of its active female members from 23 countries to discover how men react when they are refused by women in the bedroom. These were: 1. Getting angry or behaving aggressively 2. The silent treatment followed by a dramatic door-slamming exit 3. Turning on the charm and trying to convince his lover to relent 4. Taking it like a man and making a joke of it 5. Texting a booty call The most shocking behaviour reported was from women who witnessed the rejected lover pick up his phone and immediately start swiping or texting to find someone else who would put out. Typically, such cads hail from Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy, South Africa and leave little question as to whether the relationship with anything other than physical. Founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, Sigurd Vedal, said that rejecting a man in the bedroom is a woman’s right, and it’s a man’s right to have an honest reaction. “Whether it’s making a joke, firing up, turning on the charm or clamming up altogether, what we’re seeing is honest reactions from men who are in a compromising position. The reaction they choose is knee-jerk – and probably a little secret preview into what the sex might have been like if she said yes,” Vedal said.
