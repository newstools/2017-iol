London - British Gas has been fined &pound;9.5 million after the energy watchdog said its billing systems had let customers down.The Centrica-owned supplier left tens of thousands of business customers with delayed or inaccurate bills after it launched a computer billing system in March 2014, according to Ofgem.More than 6 000 new customers had delays in registering with the supplier, and British Gas Business handled many complaints over the issues poorly or not on time .Ofgem said British Gas Business came forward voluntarily in December 2014 to flag up the billing issues.Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem, said that while the firm was right to report the problems, it didn t act quickly enough to put things right .The regulator said British Gas Business failed to protect customers from issues surrounding the launch of its IT system, did not ensure its customer service processes were adequate and then did not have enough staff to deal with complaints.British Gas Business, which has around 400 000 customers, initially compensated some of those affected after discovering the billing issues.The company took action to cut the number of delayed bills and contacted customers to explain problems with the billing system.
