For those who consider themselves a little adventurous and are looking to explore a whole new method of holidaying, why not try camping or caravanning. 
 
Camping and caravanning is still the most cost effective means of accessing the diversity of KZN, where more and more people are discovering the freedom of packing a tent or caravan and getting on the road to discover Africa's more remote and exciting places. Here you can get close to the natural world while creating your own comfort and experience. 
 
Here are some tips: 
 
* To ensure a memorable camping holiday, remember to do a checklist and make sure your car is roadworthy, have towing mirrors, a caravan jack and even a fire extinguisher handy.  While on the road, try to enjoy the scenery. 
 
*Be sure to also book your holiday in advance, especially during peak season. * Always use the litter bins provided.
 
*Pack insect repellent. * Make sure you pack some entertainment, that is board games, cards and books. * Camping sites generally have lighting but it’s a very good idea to bring along your own – solar powered lanterns, flash lights and battery powered lights are always good items to have.
