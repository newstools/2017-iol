 As you’d expect given the badge, the new bakkie will be pitched as a larnier alternative to the Toyota Hilux and friends.  Although it is based on the Nissan Navara, the X-Class will have its own front and rear styling as well as a plusher and more Mercedes-appropriate cabin and Mercedes’ own 3-litre V6 turbodiesel engine in range-toppers, although the familiar Nissan engines are expected to feature lower in the range. Mercedes has already previewed the new bakkie in concept form, with last year's X-Class Concept (below), although the styling has no doubt been toned down in production form. As far as we can tell in the dark and hazy video, the front end, and particularly the headlights, have a squarer look, something that's likely to be appreciated by bakkie fans. Buyers will have the option of 4x2 and 4x4 variants, with the latter getting 4Matic permanent all wheel drive, low range and two diff locks to offer full blown offroad adventuring ability. As for the gadgets, X-Class is expected to feature all the modern connectivity and driver assistance aids. Mercedes won't reveal what they are yet but it's fairly safe to expect semi-autonomous features such as adaptive cruise control and self steering. The official reveal will take place in Cape Town on Tuesday, July 18 and IOL Motoring will be there to share the big moment with you. Stay tuned.
