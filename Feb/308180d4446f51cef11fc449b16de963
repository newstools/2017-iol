CAPE Town is known for their creative and fun artisan markets. A mix of tourists and locals can be seen at these markets, some enjoying locally produced food while others stock up on some crafts and jewellery. Come February 25, a new place called the Spot Artisan Market will be opened to the public on the last Saturday of every month. The hot new venue, situated at Rust-en-Vrede on 10 Wellington Road in Durbanville, will source locally produced items from businesses within the Cape Town community. Jansen Van Vuuren, ,  said people should expect something different and will be wowed when they visit the market. “Artisan markets have become very popular in recent years. It has been turned into a community where people enjoy spending their their weekends enjoying good food and networking. There are even some people who drive far and wide to visit these markets. “The Spot will be a place for anyone who is young at heart. We will feature art classes, florists, jewellers, eateries and architecture, giving everyone the opportunity to enjoy their passion,” she said. In a bid to expose all artisan markets in the Western Cape, the hashtag #FollowMe has been created. This means that if you are in a really cool market that you want to share with other Capetonians then you can use the hashtag on any of your social media platforms. “Not only will the hashtag showcase what we have to offer at our market, but will help people find the market that best suits their needs and location,” added van Vuuren.
