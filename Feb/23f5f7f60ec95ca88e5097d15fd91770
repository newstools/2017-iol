Those were the days when boys played outside all day wearing shorts with suspenders while little girls had tea parties with their dolls, dressed in smocked frocks and Mary Janes. These days tiny tots are outshining adults by stepping up their style game and taking over the social media as toddler fashionistas. While the grown-ups are looking to fashion influencers like reality TV star Kim Kardashian and models like Gigi Hadid for style inspiration, moms 
are now looking to these toddler 
fashionistas on how to dress their
little ones. Coincidentally the stylist behind stars like the Kardashian sisters and Hadid, is mom of two, Monica Rose. Roseâ€™s instagram not only features posts of all the celebs she styles, but the cutest pictures of her two gorgeous - and always trendy - children as well. Alaia, her daughter, and her son Sal even have their own page on her website (www.monicarose.com). When mom Monica started posting pictures of Alaia wearing Zara Kids and carrying a Givenchy handbag, little Alaia  soon became one of the best-dressed kids on the internet. I suppose when your mom is responsible for celebs stepping out in style you can be sure you will too. Rose is pregnant with her third baby and we look forward to seeing how she will be dressing her newborn. Since then, stylish toddlers have been popping up all over our Instagram feeds. A simple search of the hashtag ToddlerFashionista brings up images of trendy little ones in biker leather jackets and big coats.
