He tells us about his favourite place: New York.  Where do you stay? As an ambassador for the brand Quentessentially, I always get options of staying at some of the most fantastic hotels New York has to offer, but The W on Manhattan is perfect for me.  What do you buy? Mostly fashion items like shoes, clothes and bags.  Best walk around the city? Central Park and Greenwich village.  Any must visit spots? It is New York so there are so many must visit spots for me. They are the Meatpacking District, Tom Ford flagship store on Madison Ave,  Greenwich Village, Harlem, 5th Avenue, 44th street, Central Park, Times Square, Cathedral of Saint John the Divine and  NY Fashion Week if you are in the city.  What is your favourite view? A hidden gem is the Roosevelt Island Tramway that takes you through the city, but unlike the subway this is high above ground and offers some amazing views. You can even use your subway card.  What do you do on a free afternoon? I visit some of the different boroughs in NYC like Brooklyn, Bronx and Manhattan. There are always a lot of street activities and street art to enjoy, or I go to areas like Soho or Greenwich Village for lunch.  Best place for cocktails. Le Bain at the Standard Hotel.
