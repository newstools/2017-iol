DURBAN – Platinum Stars are interested in signing Mamelodi Sundowns marksman Abdul Fiston Razak on loan. Razak is not in Sundowns’ plans for the new season. The striker was on loan at Bloemfontein Celtic last season. A source close to the player told Independent Media that Razak might end up at Chloorkop. “Platinum Stars are interested in Razak. The only problem now is the player’s terms. They want to sign him because they lost Ndumiso Mabena, and it is not clear whether they will retain Bongi Ntuli or not,” the source stated. Mabena left Dikwena and signed for Celtic. Ntuli is still a Sundowns player, but is likely to be loaned out. Razak’s manager Lwazi Mazibuko confirmed that they do have interest from Premier Soccer League clubs regarding the player. “Yes, we do have interest, but I can’t confirm the name of the teams that want to sign him. At the moment, he is still a Sundowns player,” Mazibuko explained. An attempt to get hold of Platinum Stars general manager Senzo Mazingiza proved futile. @minenhlecr7  IOL Sport
