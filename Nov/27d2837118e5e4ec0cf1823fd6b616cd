Non-provisional taxpayers have less than three weeks to file their tax returns before tax season officially closes for this category of taxpayers on Friday, November 24. This applies to whether non-provisional taxpayers file via a branch or via eFiling. For provisional taxpayers who submit via eFiling, tax season runs until January 31 next year. The South African Revenue Service (Sars) says its tax consultants at its branches will ensure that all taxpayers are assisted with their tax returns. Sars says taxpayers filing their returns at a branch can expect an average queue time of 78 minutes, and an average service time of 8 minutes. Sars reminds you that eFiling is the easiest and quickest way to file your tax return and is available 24 hours a day. This week, Sars says, the number of income tax returns received to date has increased to over 4.5 million. A breakdown shows that 52.5% were filed at a branch,47.2% via eFiling, and a very small percentage (0.30%) has been filed manually via post.
