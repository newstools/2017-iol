Last night’s episode of Vuzu Hustle was by far the most entertaining thus far – and I’m not just saying that because I was one of the guests. The rapping was a lot stronger, there was no choking and the judges (well, AKA) finally seemed to grasp that the spotlight was not set on them. PR maven, Sheila Afari headed the media training challenge which saw me and five other media personnel test contestants' ability to interact with the media. Joshua The I Am, whose rap prowess continues to escape me, was deemed to be the strongest in this challenge, which meant that he had the power to choose who to relegate to the elimination battle. He chose Dee XCLSV. Needless to say, Dee didn't take kindly to Joshua’s decision. Fired up and eager to prove a point, Dee channeled his emotions into his raps. During the Bars Challenge, which was adjudicated by Kwesta, Dee stood head and shoulders over what was a very solid overall showing from the contestants. By winning the challenge, Dee was no longer required to fight for his life in the elimination battle. Instead, it was TTGO and J-Flow who had to battle it out for survival, while Content was sent straight home. As ever, the elimination battle did not end without controversy. After a couple of heated rounds, J-Flow was sent packing. This didn’t go down well with many on social media as it meant that the happy-go-lucky TTGO got to stay for another week. IOL
