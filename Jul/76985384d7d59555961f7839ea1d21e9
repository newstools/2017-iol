American superstar Taylor Swift and her boyfriend Joe Alwyn are "doing great" as a couple, according to an insider. The chart-topping singer and the 26-year-old actor have kept a low-profile since their romance first became public, but the duo are said to be relishing the time they're currently spending together. A source said: "Joe and Taylor are doing great. He is different than the other guys she has dated. "He is very low-key and just a chill guy overall. They get along great and really got to know each other other over the past few months." Taylor, 27, has previously been involved in a number of high-profile relationships, having dated the likes of John Mayer, Harry Styles and Calvin Harris. But the blonde beauty is making a concerted to fly below the radar with her current romance. The insider told E! News: "Taylor is just taking extra precautionary measures in this relationship so her life is not out to the world like her past relationships." Taylor apparently has no plans to change her lifestyle in the immediate future, with the source saying that the 'Shake It Off' hitmaker is focused on building her relationship with Alwyn. The insider explained: "She is keeping a very low profile and plans on staying that way as long as she can. "She is in a happy place, even though she seems like she is hiding. She is taking care of her body and is really healthy." Meanwhile, it was reported last month that Taylor's latest romance was "getting more serious". Joe spent time at Taylor's Beverly Hills and Nashville homes over one particular weekend, which served to strengthen their bond. An insider said at the time: "Taylor and Joe arrived in Nashville on Friday and spent the weekend there. "It does seem they're getting more serious. They had a great weekend together."
