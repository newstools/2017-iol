Dealing with trauma is complex. Understanding how it affects a person, even before we are born, can help us find a solution. Independent Media's #DontLookAway campaign is not just about raising awareness around violence against women and children.  It is also about helping us understand how abuse and trauma can have a lifelong impact on victims.  In this video Claudia Burger, director of Activists Networking Against Exploitation of Children (Anex), herself a survivor of domestic violence, explains how the brain works and how this makes recovery from trauma both complicated and lengthy.  The video is more than 10 minutes long, but is well worth watching, especially for victims of abuse and people who want to help change the cycle of abuse in our society. #DontLookAway
