London - Britain's Prince William is to
give up his job as an air ambulance helicopter pilot to focus on
carrying out official duties on behalf of his grandmother Queen
Elizabeth full-time, his office said on Friday. William, 34, the second-in-line to the throne, will also
base his family in London rather than their current home in
Norfolk, eastern England. "Following on from my time in the military, I have had
experiences in this job I will carry with me for the rest of my
life, and that will add a valuable perspective to my royal work
for decades to come," William said in a statement. William served in Britain's armed forces from 2006 until
2013, working latterly as a search and rescue helicopter pilot.
He then launched a new career as an air ambulance helicopter
pilot with the East Anglia Air Ambulance near his home. His office said in a statement the prince would leave his
job in the summer and move his wife Kate and children George, 3,
and Charlotte, 1, from Anmer Hall, their country mansion on the
queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, to Kensington Palace,
their official London residence. "As they have in recent years, their royal highnesses are
keen to continue to increase their official work on behalf of
the queen and for the charities and causes they support, which
will require greater time spent in London," the statement said. "Prince George will begin school in London in September and
Princess Charlotte will also go to nursery and eventually school
in London as well." The queen, who turned 90 last year, has cut down the number
of official engagements she carries out and announced before
Christmas that she would step down as patron of a number of
organisations. Those duties are being passed on to son and heir Prince
Charles and other members of the royal family. Reuters
