BERLIN â€“ Leon Bailey netted the winner as Bayer Leverkusen beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 1-0 to reach the quarter-finals of the German Cup on Wednesday. Goalless until the 71st minute, the game burst into life when Bailey broke down the left to pick up Kevin Volland's through ball and fire past Yann Sommer.  Elsewhere, Werder Bremen joined Leverkusen in the last eight by beating Freiburg 3-2. After goals from Ishak Belfodil and Florian Kainz had put Bremen two goals up within 20 minutes, Nils Petersen pulled a goal back from the penalty spot just before the half-hour mark. With 20 minutes to play, Philipp Bargfrede swept the ball in for Bremen's third, the referee overruling the linesman's offside flag. A late goal from Yoric Ravet proved too little for Freiburg.
