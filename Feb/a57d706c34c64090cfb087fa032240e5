Herndon, Virginia - Audi’s specially-filmed Super Bowl TV commercial, which will be flighted during the third quarter of the game on Monday 6 February, has already stirred up a hornet’s nest of opinions. The 60-second video features an Audi model - the S5 Sportback - only right at the end, and then obliquely. It’s the story of a downhill car race, narrated by the father of the only girl competitor, who asks whether he will have to tell her, as she grows up, how women can be valued less than men in the workplace, and even in life. The tagline at the end is: “Audi of America is committed to equal pay for equal work”. Whether that is a dig at its new president’s perceived gender bias, or even a subtle condemnation of his unrepentant bigotry in general, we can’t say; we’re not privy to Audi of America’s corporate strategy.  What we can say however, is that this video is being downliked, on average, 16 times as often as it is being liked on Youtube - which we think says more about the viewers than it does about the commercial itself.
