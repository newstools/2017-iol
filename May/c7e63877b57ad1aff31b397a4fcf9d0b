Justice Maya is the first woman to be appointed to the highest office at the Supreme Court of Appeal since the establishment of the Court in 1910. Her appointment elevates her to the third highest position in the Judicial Branch, after the Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice of the Republic. “We wish to congratulate her for being the first woman to occupy such a high position in the Judiciary and wish Justice Maya all the best in her new important responsibility of advancing our constitutional democracy,” said Zuma.
