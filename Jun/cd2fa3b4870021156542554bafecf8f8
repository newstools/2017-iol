"We want to re-emphasise that the ANC is and remains the strategic centre of power and all strategic decisions should be taken in consultation with the ANC. ANC public representatives serve at the behest of the ANC and must at all times derive their mandates from the ANC," ANC provincial secretary Deshi Ngxanga said on Thursday. "No reshuffling of executives, be it at municipal or provincial level, can take place without consultation. This principle applies to everyone deployed in strategic positions...the ANC does not plan to change its position on this matter." Lucas declined nomination for provincial chair at the conference, citing irregularities in the manner the conference was converged. She said she would petition the ANC national executive committee to review the conference and its outcomes. Former secretary Zamani Saul was elected provincial chairperson. The run-up to the conference was marred by disputes regarding membership audits, which saw a group of ANC members travel to the party's head office in Johannesburg to raise their concerns. They accused some leaders of manipulating branch lists and urged ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe to halt the conference. Provincial alliance partners, such as Cosatu, condemned Lucas' decision and accused her of sowing divisions within the party by selecting MECs loyal to her. Lucas had gone ahead with the reshuffle without consulting the party and its structures, they said. African News Agency
