Los Angeles - The most luxurious Range Rover ever has just become even more palatial with the reveal of the updated 2018 SVAutobiography ahead of this week's LA Auto Show. Hand-finished by JLR’s Special Vehicle Operations, the range-topping Rangie gains new and updated engine options as well as some swanky luxury trappings. Rear occupants don’t even have to physically close the doors once inside, as that can be achieved at a touch of a button on the rear console, after which they can sit back and relax in the airline-style seats with 40-degree recline capability as well as heated calf and foot rests, and even a hot stone massage function. The SVAutobiography is only offered in long-wheelbase form, meaning rear legroom of over 1.2 metres, according to Land Rover. Entertainment comes in the form of integrated 25.4cm rear screens and 4G WiFi connectivity, and there’s a fridge behind the rear seats that’s just big enough to hold two wine bottles. Designers also garnished the rear cabin with a Zenith high-end clock, said to be inspired by the Elite 6150 watch. This hedonistic flagship even puts paid to the ‘indignity’ of crouching into the boot to load items, thanks to an electrically-deployable veneered loading floor, although at this level you’ve probably already hired a chauffeur for that and other mundane tasks like driving. Said helper will get to enjoy JLR’s new Touch Pro Duo dual-screen infotainment system and a better driving experience, depending on which engine you select. The SVAutobiography is available with a range of engines, including a new four-cylinder petrol-electric plug-in hybrid with system outputs of 297kW and 650Nm and a claimed electric-only range of up to 51km. Also on the menu is an uprated 5-litre supercharged top dog V8, with outputs lifted to 415kW and 700Nm. The 2018 Range Rover line-up is destined for South Africa, but timing has yet to be confirmed at this stage. IOL Motoring RELATED VIDEO
