Joahnnesburg - President Jacob Zuma delivered his penultimate speech as ANC president on Friday night at a gala dinner which precedes the party's 54th national conference.  The Progressive Business Forum's (PBF) presidential gala dinner was held at the at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg, the venue of the hotly-contested conference which runs over five days and will see a new ANC president named on Sunday. Frontrunners Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosana Dlamini-Zuma will know on Sunday which of them will replace Zuma. Senior ANC leaders Lindiwe Sisulu, Zweli Mkhize, Jeff Radebe, Baleka Mbete and Mathews Phosa also campaigned for the position of party leader but look unlikely to emerge victorious. After months of lobbying, disputes, and campaigns accompanied by mudslinging, thousands of ANC delegates from across the country will make their way into the Nasrec plenary hall on Saturday.  The delegates will vote for their preferred top six leaders and National Executive Committee (NEC) members. The conference will also examine and come up with new policies ahead of the 2019 general elections.  The PBF is the ANC's fundraising entity run by former National Party minister Renier Schoeman.  Read more: Zuma pleads for unity on eve of #ANCconference Also read: NEC to discuss court judgments ahead of #ANCconference
