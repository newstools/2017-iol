Johannesburg President Jacob Zuma&nbsp;on Wednesday&nbsp;said delegates at the African National Congress 5th&nbsp;national policy conference in Johannesburg had robust discussions on the imperative to accelerate land redistribution in South Africa.&nbsp; We agree on the imperative to accelerate land redistribution and land reform. Again we had robust discussions on the modalities to achieve this. We agree that using the&nbsp;fiscus&nbsp;for land redistribution must be accompanied by other measures if we are to achieve the goal at the required pace, said Zuma in his closing remarks at the six-day conference held in Johannesburg.&nbsp; Where it is necessary and unavoidable this may include expropriation without compensation. The Constitution provides for legislative changes to be effected in the democratic process. &nbsp;Regarding education, Zuma said the conference had affirmed the ANC s stance on provision of free education.&nbsp; We wish to reiterate the policy of the ANC in regard to free education for the poor.&nbsp;&quot;As I indicated in the opening address, we await the report of the&nbsp;Heher&nbsp;Commission on modalities for the implementation of free higher education, said Zuma.&nbsp; As the ANC, we are resolute that no child from working class and poor backgrounds will be denied access to education in general and higher education in particular. &nbsp;Zuma commended the delegates from the ANC branches which were at conference for high discipline during the lengthy event.&nbsp; Your presence reaffirms the fact&nbsp;that&nbsp;the ANC is still a people s movement, a broad church and a true parliament of the people. I am proud to report that this conference discussed&nbsp;all important&nbsp;issues facing the ANC and the country in a disciplined manner befitting&nbsp;the stature of our movement as the&nbsp;leader of society, he said.&nbsp; Everyone agrees that this policy conference has been a&nbsp;watershed in the arena of the&nbsp;festival of ideas. Different ideas were articulated and debated.&nbsp;Various&nbsp;formulations&nbsp;were&nbsp;presented and&nbsp;tested so that the movement can come out of this conference with a common perspective&nbsp;on all issues that were being deliberated upon.
