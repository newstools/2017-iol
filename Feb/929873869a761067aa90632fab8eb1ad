Monte Carlo, Monaco – Australian film star Margot Robbie has made her debut as Nissan’s electric vehicle ambassador by racing the new BladeGlider sports car around the Monaco Grand Prix circuit at midnight. The Nissan BladeGlider - which will be on display at the Geneva motor show in the second week of March - is a 200kW, 190km/h prototype electric sports car that can hit 100km/h in less than five seconds. Developed from a concept first shown in 2013, it's planned as a test-bed for a range of eco-friendly future technologies that will combine intelligent mobility with sports-car performance. Robbie put the radical three-seater through its paces around the closed Monaco street circuit before racing the other BladeGlider (there are only two in existence) through the iconic Tunnel and along Massenet before finishing in Casino Square.
