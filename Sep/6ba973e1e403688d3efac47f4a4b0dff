Kim Kardashian West has ignored Pamela Anderson's letter begging her to stop wearing fur. The former 'Baywatch' actress - who is a long-time vegan and animal rights activists - penned the 36-year-old reality TV star a note a few weeks back urging her to omit animal skin, including leather, fur, feathers and suede, from her wardrobe and to show more compassion to the innocent creatures being slaughtered purely for fashion. However, her pleas have so far gone unanswered. Speaking on UK breakfast show 'Good Morning Britain', the 50-year-old star said: "Girl to girl, I think Kim has a great heart and I know she's a great influencer ... I wrote Kim Kardashian a letter and I spoke to her at fashion week. No response yet. I talk to Melania [Trump], many people that are in the public eye, to dress more compassionately because you're a role model." Although she refuses to feast on animal flesh, the blonde bombshell has admitted she's a "naughty vegan" - implying she sometimes falls of the wagon - and occasionally caves into her cravings.   She explained: "I'm vegan, that's it. I don't eat meat, it's bad for the environment, it's bad for you. I'm a naughty vegan. I try not to, but I'm not a dictator. I try to do the best I can. If you eat less meat, you're doing something better for the planet." Pamela, 50, has worked closely with the animal rights organisation PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) for many years and, during that time, has agreed to strip off and flash the flesh for some eye-catching campaigns. But the sex icon - who has two children Dylan, 19, and Brandon, 21, with her ex-husband Tommy Lee - said Â "I don't want a woman to tell me how to be a woman, or a man to tell me how to be a woman. I love being sexy and being a mum and all those feminine things that I think we should celebrate. There's good and bad with that word." Bang Showbiz
