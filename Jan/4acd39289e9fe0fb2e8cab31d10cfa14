The kids are his whole world. It's all he cares about."  And the 53-year-old actor is happy to work with his estranged wife in the hope it will make the split easier on their children. The insider added to People magazine: "Brad is willing to work with Angie so they can have peace for the kids. What it ultimately comes down to is that he just wants to be with the kids."
