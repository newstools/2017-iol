Plettenberg Bay - Hundreds of bikers as well as several firefighting vehicles rode in procession from Sedgefield, through Knysna to Plettenberg Bay on Sunday in honour of fallen firefighter, Bradley Richards. Volunteer firefighter Richards, 24, died in hospital on 9 June from severe burns sustained while fighting the huge bush-fire that began devastating parts of Plettenberg Bay and Knysna on 7 June.
