Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington has died. The 41-year-old singer reportedly took his own life and was found hanged at a private residence in Palos Verdes Estate in Los Angeles just before 9am on Thursday, TMZ reports. Just a few days ago, Chester had been seen at a recording studio with his bandmates. The 'Crawling' hitmaker - who had three children with wife Talinda Bentley and another three from previous relationships - had struggled with drugs and alcohol abuse in the past and previously admitted he had considered suicide after being abused as a child by an older male. He confessed to being a ''full blown, raging alcoholic" but had tried to put that behind him. Speaking in 2011, he said: ''I don't drink. I choose to be sober now. I have drunk over the last six years, but I just don't want to be that person anymore." He also spoke frankly about being abused. He said: ''If I think back to when I was really young, to when I was being molested, to when all these horrible things were going on around me, I shudder." The 'In the End' hitmaker was also the singer in Dead by Sunrise, and performed as frontman for Stone Temple Pilots from 2013 to 2015, as well as collaborating as a solo artist with the likes of his Santana, Motley Crue, his close friend Chris Cornell - who committed suicide in May - DJ Z-Trip and Handsome Boy Modeling School. He also had movie roles in 'Saw 3D' and both 'Crank' films. Bang Showbiz  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
