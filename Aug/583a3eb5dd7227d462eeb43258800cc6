Pretty Yende's year just keeps getting better. The opera singer has been bestowed with the ECHO Klassik Newcomer of the Year Award. The soprano's successful international singer performed in Bellini's 'I Puritani' at The Metropolitan Opera in New York in February, after lead Diana Damrau, revered as one of the greatest singing actresses, fell ill. The press and opera fraternity sang Yende's praises, saying performance was "a triumph" and "spectacular in every way." It was even more notable as she had only sung the role once before, in a non-traditional production last year in Zurich. The talented soprano was also cast as Juliette in Gounod's production of 'Romeo et Juliette'. Yende made the announcement of her win last week in a Facebook post. She wrote: “This is truly a dream come true for me, I am beyond honored to receive the Newcomer of the Year Award from ECHO Klassik. I am thrilled that my debut album " A Journey' has afforded me the thrilling luxury to be recognized by ECHO Klassik. I receive it as a deep encouragement to pursue my #prettyjourney joyously sharing this precious gift I have been entrusted with on the global world operatic stage. I am grateful to all my fans for their immense support and heartfelt thanks especially to Sony classical international, to ECHO Klassik, to the ECHO KLASSIK Award Committee, and to all my fans in Germany. sic" The singing sensation also shared another intimate moment during dinner with her Italian friends in Milan. After the restaurant owners was told who she was, they surprised her by playing her CD. She was so touched that she shared the moment with fans via Facebook Live. Yende is currently on her way back to South Africa to perform 'Mozart’s Requiem'. The award ceremony will take place on Sunday, 29 October in Hamburg, Germany at the Elbphilharmonie.
