Paris - After pulling the covers off the Dacia-branded version of its new-generation Duster at the Frankfurt Motor Show back in September, parent-company Renault has revealed the version that will wear its own diamond badge. What you see here is also the version that will be launched in South Africa. Although exact timing has yet to be confirmed, our local contact told us that it’s likely to arrive towards the end of 2018. The basic dimensions remain as before, but the Duster's exterior has been completely redesigned, albeit without too much of a departure from its predecessor’s rugged design language. You’ll notice a bigger design shift on the inside, with a completely new look and, judging by the supplied pictures, smarter-looking textures and materials. Renault says it paid particular attention to improving the ambience of the cabin, through grainy dashboard trim, ‘piano key’ type controls, chrome surrounds for the air vents and improved general fit and finish. Renault also claims to have improved ergonomics and storage space, while the redesigned seats promise improved comfort and support. New-to-Duster gadgets include blind spot warning, keyless start and a multi-view camera, bearing in mind that local specs will only be confirmed closer to launch. Same goes for the engines, but for the record European customers get to choose from 85kW (1.6) and 107kW (2.0) normally aspirated petrol engines as well as a 1.5 turbodiesel in 66kW and 81kW guises. Depending on the engine selected, buyers can choose between front-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive, and various self-shifting gearbox options are available in addition to traditional manual transmission. With a ground-clearance of 210mm, the Duster is likely to remain among the best off-roaders in the compact class. IOL Motoring
