DURBAN – Golden Arrows and Maritzburg United played to a 0-0 draw in an Absa Premiership fixture at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Sunday afternoon. After a cagey opening, in which both teams sussed each other out, it was Arrows’ Nduduzo Sibiya who tried his luck from distance, but the attempt was easily dealt with by Maritzburg goalkeeper Richard Ofori. In typical derby fashion, both teams weren’t afraid to have a go at each other. Arrows, though, again went close when some nice interplay between Kudakwashe Mahachi and Velemseni Ndwandwe created a threatening situation for the opposition, but the defence was able to clear. It was a tight affair, but the opportunities when they came in the opening 45 minutes, fell to Arrows, with Ndwandwe shooting over the bar, Knox Mutizwa heading wide and Thomas Chideu drilling an effort off-target. In the second half, though, Maritzburg came out with greater fight and commitment, and created quite a few chances. Mohau Mokate went close and later, Evans Rusike was desperately unlucky not to score. Arrows looked for more thrust in attack by bringing on Lerato Lamola in place of Chideu. Mokate then had another opportunity for the Team of Choice, but his headed effort flew narrowly wide of goal. Maritzburg made two substitutions, with Sheldon van Wyk coming in for Mokate, and Bandile Shandu replacing Deolin Mekoa. Van Wyk quickly made his presence felt as he produced an intelligent pass to release Lebohang Maboe into the penalty area, but the attacker was foiled by a brilliant tackle from Arrows defender Limbikani Mzava. With both teams trying to snatch a late winner, Arrows’ Siphelele Magubane attempted a long-range shot, but the ball screamed over the bar. In the end, neither team were able to break the deadlock, and a goalless outcome was a fair reflection of the action on show. African News Agency (ANA)
