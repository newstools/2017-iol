 CAN’T SLEEP? TRY LISTENING TO PINK NOISE... HALF of us experience insomnia to varying degrees and many find it easier to nod off while listening to ‘white noise’ via machines or apps playing background noise such as the sound of rain. But a US study suggests noise with a drone of low frequency coupled with higher tones, known as ‘pink noise’, has the most soothing effect. Volunteers who listened to pink noise in their sleep had better memory the next day than those who listened to white noise or nothing at all. Researchers say it sounds a bit like running water, and numerous apps and noise generators now have a pink noise setting. © Mail On Sunday
