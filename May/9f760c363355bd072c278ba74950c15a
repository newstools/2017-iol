That, says the maker, is worth celebrating, so it has created the Landmark Edition, shown to the world for the first time today at the Royal Windsor Horse Show, and due for South African release in October 2017. It’s based on the Dynamic trim, but comes with a special body kit, and in one of three exclusive metallic colours – grey, white and a dramatic signature blue supposedly inspired by the turquoise lakes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The exterior trim is all in various shades of grey, including a standard-fit fixed panoramic roof, glossy 19 inch rims, grille and badge lettering. The dark grey theme continues inside with a brushed satin centre console trim elements, set off by black leather upholstery with perforated centre panels and pale grey top stitching. Standard kit includes keyless entry and start, powered gesture tailgate, options start with a 25cm InControl Touch Pro system featuring apps such as Spotify and a 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, and go on to the Remote Premium app that links with your phone smart or watch to check the car’s fuel level, where you parked it, whether it’s locked and even pre-heat or cool the cabin while you finish your latte. Pricing for the the South African market will be announced, and orders will open, in June. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
