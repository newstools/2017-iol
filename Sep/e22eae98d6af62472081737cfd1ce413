Stuttgart - Porsche’s Panamera Sport Turismo, which is the ‘wagon’ version in Porsche speak, has finally been given the full-fat Turbo S E-Hybrid treatment and it has exactly the same performance credentials as its conventional Panamera sibling. Likewise it’s fitted with a potent hybrid drivetrain that mates a 4-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine to an electric motor for system outputs of 500kW and 850Nm, allowing a (claimed) 3.4-second zero to 100km/h sprint and 310km/h top speed. Power goes to all four wheels through an eight-speed PDK gearbox and Porsche Traction Management adaptive all-wheel-drive system and if plugged in to a wall socked beforehand, the vehicle can cover up to 49km on electric power alone. The 4+1 seat Sport Turismo is touted as a slightly more practical alternative to the conventional Panamera three-box hatch, boasting additional rear headroom, a wider-opening electric tailgate and 425 litres worth of luggage space (increasing to 1295 litres when the back seats are folded). The Sport Turismo also sports an adaptive roof spoiler, which is set to one of three different angles depending on the driving situation and vehicle settings, and which can generate an additional 50kg of downforce on the rear axle. Standard kit on the Turbo S E-Hybrid includes adaptive air suspension, Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control and Active Suspension Management, the Sport Chrono Package, 21-inch alloy wheels and ceramic composite brakes. Furthermore, this model can also be ordered with Porsche’s rear-axle steering. South African pricing and availability has yet to be disclosed. IOL Motoring
