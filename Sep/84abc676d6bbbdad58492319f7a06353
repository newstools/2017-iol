Brits - A 24-year-old farmer has been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a man in Majakaneng near Brits, North West police said on Sunday. He was expected to appear in the Brits Magistrate's Court on a charge of attempted murder on Monday, Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said. The suspect was arrested on Saturday, following an intensive investigation into the alleged attempted murder of 24-year-old Tebogo Ndlovu of Majakaneng. "The suspect allegedly shot Ndlovu on [Wednesday] 2 August 2017 at one of the farms in the vicinity of Mooinooi. At the time of the incident Tebogo and two other men were allegedly stealing oranges when the farmer fired shots towards them," Mokgwabone said. Ndlovu was apparently wounded and his two companions left him and ran away from the farm. He has not been seen since. The incident was reported to police two days later Ndlovu's disappearance sparked a mass violent protest in which five vehicles were burnt and the N4, R104, and R566 were barricaded. "The police have been working hard, including conducting of searches in the area since the day the incident was reported, hence [the] appearance of the suspect in court tomorrow [Monday]," Mokgwabone said. The search for Ndlovu was continuing. "The police request anyone with information that may assist in the tracing of Ndlovu to contact the investigation team on 082-416-0767." North West police commissioner Lt-Gen Baile Motswenyane commended the team of investigators, stakeholders, and all individuals who contributed in the investigation that led to the arrest. She urged members of the community to work together with police and refrain from damaging property or barricading roads.
