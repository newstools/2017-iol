EDINBURGH - World champions New Zealand held off a game challenge to keep intact their 112-year unbeaten record against Scotland with a hard-fought 22-17 win at Murrayfield on Saturday. The All Blacks outscored their hosts three tries to two, but were given a tough test by a side who are still to beat them in 33 meetings. Codie Taylor, Damian McKenzie and Beauden Barrett scored tries for New Zealand after the sides were deadlocked at 3-3 at halftime, while Jonny Gray stretched over for Scotland’s first try and Huw Jones added a second three minuets from time.
