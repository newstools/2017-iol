The Newlands faithful will be able to pose with the Currie Cup and get a picture taken free of charge on Friday, November 3 from 2pm to 6.30pm. Following Western Province’s victory against the Sharks in the final in Durban, the Currie Cup trophy will be on display at Newlands in the tunnel foyer, which will be open to the general public for a viewing on Friday. Each supporter will have the chance to have their picture taken by a professional photographer with the Currie Cup, which will then be available online at no cost. Supporters will enter Newlands at the southern Danie Craven end of the stadium near the traffic circle on Boundary Road and the Sports Science Institute. Staff will be on hand to guide each supporter to the player foyer and once your picture with the trophy has been taken and a link sent via SMS, fans will exit the foyer area opposite the stadium shop. Parking will be available at Dulwich Road and Towers parking areas on a first-come first-served basis. Western Province Rugby chief executive Paul Zacks said that this is a great opportunity to share the success of the WP team with the fans. “The support of the Newlands faithful is unrivalled, and we want to ensure that they are a part of this, our 34th Currie Cup title,” he said. President of the Western Province Rugby Football Union, Thelo Wakefield, said that he is looking forward to seeing a big turnout at Newlands on Friday. “It is crucial that we stand together with the Newlands faithful, we would like all of our supporters to have their own special experience with the Currie Cup,” he said.
