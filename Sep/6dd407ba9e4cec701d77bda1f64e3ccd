BLOEMFONTEIN – Baroka FC’s superb start to the Absa Premiership season continued on Wednesday night when they beat Bloemfontein Celtic 2-0 at the Free State Stadium. It was a third successive league win for coach Kgoloko Thobejane and his team, who move up to second on the PSL table behind pace-setters Golden Arrows on goal difference only, with Arrows having secured a last-gasp win away to Platinum Stars. After a tightly-contested first half, Bakgaga struck two minutes before the break when midfielder Sipho Moeti put the ball into Patrick Tignyemb’s net. Celtic came out looking for an equaliser after halftime, but Baroka keeper Virgil Vries was in inspired form as he kept the Limpopo team’s lead intact. Having soaked up the pressure, Baroka were to hit Phunya Sele Sele with a late sucker punch when substitute Gift Motupa netted three minutes from time to inflict a first defeat on Celtic this season.
