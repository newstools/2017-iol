Mzansi’s youngest club DJ, Oratilwe Hlongwane, best known as DJ Arch Jr has broken the Guinness World Record by becoming the youngest club DJ in the world.
 
The five-year old DJ sensation was officially inducted into the record books on Wednesday, September 13, after successfully beating Japanese six-year-old Itsuki Morita’s record.
 The young DJ performed his record-breaking one hour-long set on June 10, after his father Glen Hlongwane managed to sneak the youngster into the Platinum Lounge in Cosmo City. This was DJ Arch Jr's third attempt. His first attempt was two years ago when the young boy wasn’t able to concentrate long enough to complete the hour.

Arch Jr was crowned SA’s Got Talent winner in 2015. He's a resident deejay for the Mc Donald’s U/14 Schools Soccer League, and has performed at the SAFTA’s (South African Film Awards) and AFRIMA’s (All Africa Music Awards) in Nigeria. IOL
