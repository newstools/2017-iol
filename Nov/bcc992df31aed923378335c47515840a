'Fast and Furious' star Tyrese Gibson is locked in court battle with his ex wife Norma Gibson, which has resulted in the star not seeing his daughter Shayla for a couple of months. It is alleged that Tyrese pushed Shayla to the ground and beat her in a rage, leading Norma to keep their daughter away from him. The Fast and Furious star insists that is not the case and that his former spouse is just bitter because of his marriage to social worker Samantha Lee Gibson, which took place earlier this year. Tyrese has recently been ranting and raving about the court battle, as well as his feud with co-star Dwayne The Rock Johnson. He mentioned how he's going broke because of legal fees and that The Rock still hasn't called him back about the next Fast And Furious movie. In a recent Instagram post, Tyrese threatened to quit The Fast and Furious franchise if the The Rock would play a role in Fast9.     Cats like Tyrese behave like chumps with their wives, lose their money & custody of the kids in a divorce. Then blame other men for it?
