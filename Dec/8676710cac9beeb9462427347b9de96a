Once it’s up, customers will be able to choose to pre-order it and have the app delivered when it’s ready.  The feature is available on all iterations of the App Store, so iOS, macOS, and even tvOS apps can all be offered for pre-order. Developers can offer both free and paid pre-orders. If the price changes during the pre-order period, customers will be charged for the lower amount: the price they pre-ordered it at, or the price at the launch.  Also read: Apple's iPhone X parts cost R1 631 more than iPhone 8 They won’t be charged until the app downloads.
