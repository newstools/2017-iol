“You have no choice but to be a super star,” says Somizi just a few minutes before Paxton was announced as Idols SA season 13 winner. 17-year old Paxton Fielies becomes the youngest winner in the history of the South African Idols competition. After a gruelling competition and a record breaking season with nearly 100 million votes cast, the winner of Idols SA season 13 Paxton takes home the big prize of over one million rand.  The grand finale took place at Carnival City during a spectacular live show where the grade 11 pupil was crowned this year's winner.  The teen from Bishops Lavis, was the first to receive a Golden Ticket during auditions in Cape Town. Congratulations Paxton, as family and fans celebrate this great milestone.  Paxton walks away with a brand new Ford Focus, R1 000 000, in cash prize, R50 000 worth of a fashion voucher from Truworths, R20 000 of musical instrument from YAMAHA, and a Recording deal. IOL
