Vereeniging - Three people were killed, including a two-year-old boy, and six other people were injured, some critically, when two cars collided head-on on the R558 above the N1 in Sebokeng, Vereeniging on Saturday, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find the two mangled vehicles on the left-hand side of the road. Both vehicles had sustained a considerable amount of damage in the collision, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. Upon closer inspection, paramedics discovered the bodies of a woman and a two-year-old boy trapped in one of the cars, while the body of a man was found trapped inside the second car. "Unfortunately, all three patients had already succumbed to their multiple injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead. Five other patients, including a 12-year-old child, were found on the scene. Further assessments showed that their injuries ranged from minor to critical." Paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, the critically injured child was airlifted by the ER24 Oneplan helicopter to a nearby hospital for urgent treatment. The remaining patients were transported by ambulance to nearby hospitals for further treatment. "It is understood that another child was transported privately to a nearby hospital prior to the arrival of emergency services. Rescue services had to use the jaws-of-life equipment to later free the deceased from the vehicles," Meiring said. The cause of the collision was not yet known.  African News Agency
