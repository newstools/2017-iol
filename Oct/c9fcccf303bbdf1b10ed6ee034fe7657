DURBAN – Wits forward Hellings “Gabadinho” Mhango is set to appear before the Premier Soccer League disciplinary committee for his offence against AmaZulu. Mhango spat in the direction of Michael Morton when Wits were humbled 3-0 by AmaZulu in an Absa Premiership clash last month at King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi. AmaZulu wrote to the PSL as they wanted the league to take action against Mhango. AmaZulu manager Qedi Dlamini confirmed that they did receive feedback from the PSL. “Yes, we did receive the response from the PSL last week informing us that Mhango will appear before the PSL DC,” Dlamini explained. Earlier on Monday, the PSL revealed the list of DC cases, but Mhango was not on it. PSL acting chief executive Mato Madlala said they were still waiting for the prosecutor to advise on the case. “It is one of the cases that are pending. We are waiting for the prosecutor to advise us,” Madlala elaborated. Isolezwe, IOL Sport
