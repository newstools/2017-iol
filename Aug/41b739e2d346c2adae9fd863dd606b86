CAPE TOWN – The Mother City has lost a National First Division (NFD) club after Tuesday’s announcement that Milano United have been sold. The Grassy Park-based club’s NFD franchise was snapped up by a consortium from the Limpopo Province. In a statement, the PSL said: “The Executive Committee of the Premier Soccer League has approved the sale transaction application from Milano United in terms of Article 14 of the NSL Handbook. “As a result of approval granted, Milano United have been sold, and the club will campaign in the National First Division in Limpopo under the name Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhadila Football Club.” It’s the second Cape NFD club that has been sold ahead of the new season. Last month, FC Cape Town sold their NFD status to the Ubuntu Trust, but the club will remain in the city, playing under the name Ubuntu Cape Town. With Milano sold, and Santos relegated to the Second Division last season, the Mother City has three remaining NFD clubs doing battle for promotion to the PSL – Stellenbosch FC, Cape Town All Stars and Ubuntu. @Reinerss11  IOL Sport  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
