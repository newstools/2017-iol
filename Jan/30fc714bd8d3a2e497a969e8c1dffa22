Washington - US&nbsp;president-elect Donald Trump stressed Friday that Mexico will indeed pay for a wall designed to halt illegal immigration on the US-Mexican border despite efforts by Republican lawmakers to fund the construction.&quot;The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!&quot; Trump tweeted.The remarks followed media reports that Congress was considering funding construction through the appropriations process later this year using existing authorization for border security.Trump had stated in October that Mexico would reimburse the cost of the wall rather than funding the construction outright, spokesman Sean Spicer said.Trump made opposition to illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign, vowing to construct a wall along the US-Mexican border to prevent the entry of many immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America.ANA-dpa
