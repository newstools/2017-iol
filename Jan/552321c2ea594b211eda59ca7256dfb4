Airbnb and Pantone have come together to unveil a transformational experience that will be available to guests from all around the world. The ‘Outside In’ house, hosted by Pantone, now open for bookings 27-30 January, will provide an antidote to January blues and encourage all those who enter it to embrace 2017 with fresh optimism and excitement. Bringing to life PANTONE 15-0343 Greenery, the PANTONE Colour of the Year 2017, a home in London’s Clerkenwell has undergone a metamorphosis, transforming into an indoor-outdoor oasis so that for the very first time, people can truly live the colour.  Promoting growth and vitality for the year ahead, the home will feature a woodland reception, an indoor greenhouse that doubles as a dining room, garden bedroom with mown lawn, topiaries and soporific plants, a tented cubby-hole for children to sleep in and a herb garden kitchen.  Each year the Pantone Colour Institute selects a PANTONE Colour of the Year; a symbolic shade that provides a colour snapshot of what we see taking place in our culture at a particular moment in time.     Laurie Pressman, VP of the Pantone Colour Institute, states, “As PANTONE 15-0343 Greenery is a warm and zesty yellow-green shade that speaks to our desire to disconnect, replenish and energize, It seemed a natural extension for us to partner with Airbnb for the very first time to bring the Pantone Colour of the Year 2017 to life...  "The holistic view of travel and community – on promoting a feeling of connecting to nature and each other no matter where we go – speaks to the spirit of Greenery and has changed the way we explore, and experience cities internationally.”  Adapted from a press release, IOL
