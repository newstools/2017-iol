DURBAN – A Royal Eagles midfielder is facing a case of culpable homicide following the death of Maritzburg United player Mlondi “Vicks” Dlamini. The player was the driver when Dlamini lost his life in a car accident on Sunday. They were driving from Durban to Pietermaritzburg alongside their friend, who is still on trial at the Team of Choice. The driver of the car lost control of his car, which overturned several times. The case of culpable homicide has been opened against the player. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Thulani Zwane confirmed the case. “Yes, we can confirm that the accident occurred at 6.30pm on Sunday. One of the people who were in the car died at the scene, and the two were taken to the hospital. The case of culpable homicide has been opened at Hammarsdale Police Station,” Zwane stated. The player was at the Team of Choice last season, where he played alongside Dlamini for the MultiChoice Diski Challenge team, and cannot be named until he appears in court. Farook Kadodia, who is the chairman of  Maritzburg United, was left devastated by the accident. “We were still expecting a lot from Mlondi. The boy has been with us for seven years. In the next three years, I have no doubt that he was going to be a star for Bafana Bafana. Mlondi was a top talent. “I believe that the time has arrived where we need to hold workshops and speak about these things. This is a huge loss for the club,” Kadodia lamented. Royal Eagles general manager James Dlamini blamed the players for not listening. “This is hurting. Our boys don’t want to listen when we tell them that travelling at night is not okay. The saddest part is that the accident took away somebody’s life. “The car can be replaced, but the life of an individual can’t. We are feeling the pain as the club for what happened,” Dlamini explained. @minenhlecr7  IOL Sport
