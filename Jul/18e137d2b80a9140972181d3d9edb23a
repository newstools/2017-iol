Until the end of this week, higher than normal high tide and lower than normal low tide are to be expected with the spring tide. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said: “During spring tide the rip currents are stronger than normal, and although rip currents at all times pose a danger to bathers, they pose the greatest danger during that period.” Spring tide happens twice a month, at full moon and at new moon. Bathers, anglers, sightseers and shoreline hikers are the most at risk of being swept out to sea while swimming. “Even bathers wading in shallow water who find themselves trapped in a rip current that forms suddenly are at risk of being swept out to sea," said Lambinon. He said beachgoers should only swim where and when lifeguards were on duty. “Swim between the red and yellow flags,” he advised. In case of immediate danger, Lambinon said: “If you are caught in a rip current, you should not panic. Simply stay afloat by treading water. Don’t try to swim against the current as it will only cause you exhaustion and let the current sweep you out to sea. "At your first opportunity, swim parallel to the beachfront until you are free of the rip current and then use the incoming waves to get back to shore. Never swim into a rip to rescue somebody, but alert people and call for help.” Meanwhile, the search for the body of 7-year-old Louise Fowler  continues. Last month, the Claremont girl was swept off the rocks at Betty’s Bay while she was standing beside her mother.
