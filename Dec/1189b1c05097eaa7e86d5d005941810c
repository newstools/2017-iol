New Delhi - A man suspected of hacking another man to death and
setting him on fire in an apparent religious attack in India's
Rajasthan has been arrested, police said Thursday. The suspected attacker also recorded the attack on video and
circulated it on social media with a warning that those indulging in
"love jihad" would meet a similar fate. Radical Hindu groups claim Muslim men seduce Hindu women and convince
them to change their religion and marry them - something they
describe as "love jihad." The arrest came after the video, in which the attacker is seen
hacking the man with an axe, went viral in Rajsamand district on
Wednesday, superintendent of police Manoj Kumar said. The man, whom the police have identified as Shambhu Lal Regar, looks
at the camera and justifies the apparent killing, saying it was done
to protect the honour of Hindus against Muslims. "We have found a charred body on a roadside and identified it as that
of Afrazul Khan, a 45-year-old Muslim daily wage labourer from West
Bengal," Kumar said.  "Prima facie it appears to be the body of the victim in the video;
investigations are on." The internet has been suspended in the region and people have been
requested not to circulate the video.  "A suspect has been arrested. Probe is on. No one will be spared,"
Gulab Singh Kataria, Rajasthan home minister, said.  Rajasthan is governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party.  DPA
