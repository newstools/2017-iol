 JOHANNESBURG – These eleven players put in a real shift over the past week, particularly the Chippa United quartet of goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi, defenders Diamond Thopola and Justice Chabalala as well as striker Rhulani Manzini, who came off the bench in a league match against SuperSport United last Wednesday to bag a hat-trick in a 3-0 victory. With coach Dan Malesela returning from “special leave” to try and boost the club’s chances of survival, the Chilli Boys also doubled their efforts in the Nedbank Cup semi-final against a SuperSport side that boasted eight changes to their line-up three days later. But Chippa were unfortunate to go down 4-2 on penalties and miss out of their first ever cup final. SuperSport played more as a collective, making it difficult to single out one player. However, their skipper Dean Furman worked his socks off to cut supplies to the Chippa forwards in the cup game, so is deservedly picked for our Team of the Week. At Bidvest Wits last week, young Reeve Frosler again impressed as the Clever Boys were crowned league champions with a game to spare, proving yet again why he is so highly rated and is keeping the experienced Siboniso Gaxa on the sidelines.
