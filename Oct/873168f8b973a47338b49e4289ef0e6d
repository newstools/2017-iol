Local travel can be as exciting as an international adventure. Siphesihle Penny Ndlela, the owner of Soul Traveller, said South Africa is an attractive destination that local should explore.  She recently launched Soul Traveller Tours that is pioneering group travel in Africa and changing the face of domestic tourism in South Africa. “Soul Traveller Tours is the result of a collaboration with Thebe Tourism Group, who are committed to rejuvenating domestic travel as a means of local economic growth. “With more than 70% of domestic travel in South Africa accounted to visiting friends and relatives, there is an opportunity to grow leisure travel where people choose to have an holiday in their own country,” she said. While Ndlela understands the drawbacks of why many South Africans prefer international over local, including cost, she said that ‘immersive tourism’, that connects local travellers with the beauty and intricacy of South Africa’s landscapes, culture, history and people, can be the answer. “South Africa is an attractive destination, not just for international visitors, but everyday South Africans. We offer the world in one place, from history, culture, wine routes, beach holidays, safaris and so much more. “While people may not view it as value for money or would rather spend more towards an international holiday, our country offers very affordable deals and allows travellers to have new found respect for our country,” she said. Home to some of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including iSimangaliso Wetland Park, Cradle of Humankind, Robben Island and Vredefort Dome, Ndlela believes that the country has unique stories to be told. “South Africa has a message of battling dark history to remaining triumphant. We have layers of stories that are so rich and inspiring,” she added. Her travel packages are based on the colours of the South African national flag, ranging from nature, adventure, beach, heritage and urban culture and food.
