Among those implicated in collusion was Stanley s, it says. The company stands accused of engaging in cover pricing with Cape Express, and has admitted to the offences. Stanley s and the Commission could not come to an agreement on the quantum of the penalty and the matter was brought to the tribunal, it says. Recommended The Competition Commission had recommended a fine of 10 percent of Stanley s turnover per instance, for eight offences, but the tribunal in its reasons said it had reduced the fine to keep it in line with the settlement agreements of other furniture companies, such as Stanley s co-accused Cape Express, which was fined R645 710 for 1 744 incidents. The Tribunal made it clear that, even though the settlements by way of consent orders do not create binding precedent in opposed matters, they can be used as a yardstick for setting an appropriate penalty. The tribunal based its fine on the turnover for the 2012 financial year, it says. Other furniture companies who have settled include: Joel Transport (R150 582) for 12 offences: Reliable Removals (R90&nbsp;563) for six offences and Del Transport R210&nbsp;415.&nbsp;H&amp;M Removals has been fined R196 364.15.&nbsp;JH Retief Transport has paid the highest fine so far (R4 273 060.80) for 3 487 instances of cover pricing.
