Cape Town - The extent of the wealthy, politically connected Gupta family’s "web of corruption" is becoming increasingly evident and Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula needs to explain to Parliament the "outrageous access" the Guptas had to classified military information, the Democratic Alliance said on Sunday. The DA would write to the chair of Parliament's defence committee to request that Mapisa-Nqakula urgently brief the committee on how the Gupta family gained access to classified military information for their much reported Sun City family wedding in 2013, DA spokesman Kobus Marais said. The minister should appear before Parliament without any delay when Parliament resumed its business in August, he said. According to media reports on Sunday, classified information such as dissemination maps and aviation charts of the Waterkloof Air Force Base in Pretoria were sent to the Gupta family over insecure email systems ahead of the Sun City wedding. "If these allegations are true, the Gupta family and their associates were potentially in contravention of the Defence Act, South African Revenue Service [SARS] Act, and the Customs and Excise Act, as they failed to request or receive any approval from the South African Civil Aviation Authority, the defence force, and SARS," Marais said. "The extent of the Guptas’ web of corruption is becoming increasingly evident. Not only have they captured and corrupted the ANC, they have captured our entire government including our military services to serve their interests. "Minister Mapisa-Nqakula must come before Parliament to explain this outrageous access the Guptas has had to our country’s military services. The DA will continue to explore every possible avenue to bring an end to the utter corruption of the Guptas and their stooges," Marais said. African News Agency
