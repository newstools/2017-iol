One Direction star Louis Tomlinson has received a series of death threats, according to a report. The 25-year-old singer has handed the intimidating messages over to the Los Angeles Police Department after he was warned his family would be skinned and turned into "bed sheets". The One Direction star - who has 19-month-old son Freddie with his ex-girlfriend Briana Jungwirth - first started receiving the shocking text messages and pornographic images through WhatsApp, according to Gossip Cop, which also claims the abuse was being sent from three separate numbers.

(sic)" Louis responded to one of the offensive messages in a bid to discourage the sender, but it didn't make any difference and the chart-topping star subsequently opted to take the issue to the police. Louis and his attorney Blair Berk have met with officers in person to discuss the abusive messages, with the singer reportedly believing a female American between the age of 18 and 25 is behind them. This comes shortly after Louis insisted he won't pressure his son to follow him into showbusiness. The singer - who has found solo success with his singles 'Just Hold On' and 'Back To You' - said Freddie can do whatever he wants when he gets older. Louis reflected: "Those decisions are down to him when he's old enough. He can do whatever he wants." What's more, Louis revealed that while he never intended to have a baby with his ex-girlfriend, he considers fatherhood to be a "blessing". He shared: "I wouldn't have made this decision if someone asked me on the day. "But thank God that the decision was made for me because it's just a blessing to be this age and to be able to have a child."
