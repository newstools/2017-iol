Another day and yet another crossover, you might say, but Audi is all the wiser for plugging every gap that it can in this hip-and-happening world of compact kerb hoppers. On that note, the Q2 certainly seems to have the trendy looks to make it big here, but first let’s size it up. At 4190mm in length, it’s closer in size to the A3 Sportback (with which it shares its MQB underpinnings) than it is to the A1 equivalent, and the newcomer is actually slightly wider than the A3, while also riding higher as you’d expect – with 35mm of added ground clearance. Yet the Q2 looks a lot more funky than the A3 Sportback or its larger Q3 sibling for that matter. Like the A3 three-door, there is a bit of a wedge shape going on in the C-pillar, in an apparent salute to the original Audi Quattro of the 1980s. Its octagonal grille appears chunkier than the noses adorning other modern Audis, while the colour-contrasting C-pillar ‘blade’ panel and single-unit tail lights are also departures from the familiar Audi design idiom. Inside it looks very similar to the A3 and the materials appear suitably expensive in that typically Audi fashion. Just like the exterior can be glammed up with numerous accessories, the cabin continues the funkification with some bright colour options (such as yellow, orange or red) for inlays, contrast stitching and sections of the seats, and there’s a 10-colour LED mood lighting system on the options list. You can also order your Q2 with that colourful 31.2cm ‘Virtual Cockpit’ digital instrument cluster, which technically costs R6 400, but to have it you must also order an MMI navigation system for a further R24 000. Talking gadgets, other nifty options come in the form of head-up display as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. There’s a further glut of available gizmos to help the driver out, and these include adaptive cruise control with ‘stop & go’ traffic assist, pre-sense frontal hazard detection and the latest semi-automatic park assist system with cross traffic assist for reversing. When it comes to the sensible subject of practicality, however, the Q2 won’t be the most spacious family car on offer at the price, but it does at least have a roomy 405-litre boot, which is even bigger than the A3’s. The Q2 inherits its engines from that aforementioned sibling, although the only option available at launch will be the latest 1.4-litre TFSI turbopetrol, sporting cylinder-deactivation technology and rated at 110kW and 250Nm. A 1-litre, three-cylinder turbopetrol with 85kW and 200Nm will become available in May this year, along with a 2-litre turbodiesel that’s good for 105kW and 350Nm. The latter is fitted as standard with an S-Tronic dual-clutch automated transmission, which is optional on the petrol versions. This vehicle is so in tune with modern crossover trends that you can’t even have it with Quattro all-wheel drive, although some overseas markets do offer that option. The front-wheel driven Q2s ditch the A3’s multi-link rear suspension system for a basic torsion beam. Audi does offer an adaptive damping system for those seeking more control over the ride-handling balance. Key standard features on the Q2 include an MMI ‘radio plus’ four-speaker audio system with Bluetooth connectivity, cruise control, automatic lights and windscreen wipers and a leather-covered multi-function steering wheel. Base models ride on 16” alloy wheels, while Sport models gain 17” five-arm ‘Star’ rims, along with front and rear bumper diffusers, and door sill trims, finished in aluminium. Inside, Sports are set apart by front sports seats, upholstered in fancier cloth, and red inlays. As you’ll see below, the Q2 is priced at the premium end of the compact crossover market, but it should make friends among the trend-setting types who are willing to pay that bit extra for style and brand cachet.
