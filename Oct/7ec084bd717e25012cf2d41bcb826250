Cape Town - The Period Project South Africa, in collaboration with the Ikhozi Lendlela motorcycle club, will be hosting its second "Pad Run" on 15 October 2017. This dignity ride is part of the drive to raise enough sanitary towels for 1500 young women in Grade 12 during 2018. The run will start from N1 City MacDonalds at 80am and take the riders about 190km up the West Coast to De Watergat at Langebaan for breakfast. As their entry fee, riders are asked to bring sanitary towels (in preference to tampons) or make a cash donation in lieu thereof. Thanks to generous support from the public, friends and corporates, the Period Project has to date supplied 1065 young women with sanitary towels for a year each, most of them pupils at schools on the Cape Flats, although sanitary towels have been distributed to schools as far afield as Atlantis, De Doorns and Willowmore in the Eastern Cape. For further information contact Eldrid Petersen on 082 603 8269, Maggie Naidoo on 079 925 8371 or Paul Jacobs on 079 395 2744. IOL Motoring
