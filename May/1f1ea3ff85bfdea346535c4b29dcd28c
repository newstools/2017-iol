SOUTH AFRICA bounced back to bowl England out for just 153, in the third and final one-day at Lordâ€™s on Monday. Kagiso Rabada (four for 39), Keshav Maharaj (three for 25) and Wayne Parnell (three for 43) did the damage, as England capitulated to 20 for six at one point. The South Africans caught surely, and had a lot more intensity, after two poor showings in their previous matches. Rabada just missed out on a five-wicket haul, as Maharaj came back to clean up the tail.  Independent Media   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
