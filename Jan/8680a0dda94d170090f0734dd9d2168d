The club made the announcement on Friday, with other new arrivals being former Bloemfontein Celtic defender Thabang Matuka, ex-Kaizer Chiefs fullback Simphiwe Mtsweni, Ghana-born striker Mohammed Anas and Gabonese forward Allen Nono. Both Matuka and Anas have also previously played for Maritzburg United, while Ntuli was once on the books of Dutch club FC Twente, but failed to make the grade in the Netherlands. “We have made use of the window period and the Afcon break in making sure that we assess and sign five quality players to strengthen the team,” Stars general manager Rantsi Mokoena said. “The team is ready to compete in the second round of the season. “We were struggling to find the back of the net and we have brought in two quality strikers to help out Sekotlong upfront, whose injury is coming well and should be ready in no time. “We also struggled a bit on the left hand side but we have also brought in two experienced players to compete in that department,” he added. “As Free State Stars we would like to wish the players that have left the team the best of luck in their future endeavours and we warmly welcome the new guys.” The club have also confirmed that the following players were released by mutual consent, Reabetsoe Rakoti, Tshepo Mothiba, David Booysen, Johnny Mathole, Brandon Dean, Hamis Kizza and Mohamed Aoudou.
