DURBAN – Kaizer Chiefs are set to pass on Argentinian marksman Jonatan Philippe, who is still on trial with the Amakhosi. The 29-year-old arrived in the country with a big reputation, having played for Boca Juniors in Argentina. A well-placed source told Independent Media that Philippe is unlikely to be signed by Chiefs. “The guy is not special. Chiefs are in search of a box striker. They need someone who can stay in the box and finish chances. This guy has not impressed. He has been at Chiefs for three weeks,” a source stated. Chiefs lost 1-0 to SuperSport United in the quarter-final of the MTN8 at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday night. They missed numerous opportunities in the match and hit the framework on three occasions. Chiefs have already let three strikers leave – Togo’s Camaldine Abraw, as well as Edward Manqele and Siphelele Mthembu, who are both trying their luck at Free State Stars. Amakhosi are left with Bernard Parker, Gustavo Paez and young Ryan Moon upfront at the moment. Nigerian striker Okiki Afolabi is set to begin training with Amakhosi this week, according to reports. Chiefs mentor Steve Komphela made it clear that he is yet to make a decision on whether they will sign Philippe. “We are still assessing Philippe and the decision will be made, because as you saw, you can’t blame it on strikers. We can’t say if we signed Philippe, things would have been different. “Chances are created. Maybe we need someone with luck for goal-scoring. Luck is sometimes crazy. If you looked at the match between Lamontville Golden Arrows and Bidvest Wits (on Friday), it was all about luck. “You can’t go back and refer to that because there’s a difference – either in Clinton Larsen (Arrows coach) or Gavin Hunt (Wits coach) – but in terms of luck and relation to luck, go back to that game. “They worked hard Bidvest hey, make no mistake, but they were lucky as well. Luck was on their side on the night,” Komphela explained. @minenhlecr7  IOL Sport
