The visitors posted a challenging 251/7 after electing to bat first, with Mignon du Preez and Chloe Tryon scoring a respective 79 (108 balls, six fours) and 47 (54 balls, seven fours) runs. Bangladesh’s Khadija Tul Kubra had the most success with the ball in hand, taking 3/48 in 10 overs. The South African bowling unit did a remarkable job to restrict the hosts to 157. Ayabonga Khaka led the pack with her 3/34, with Moseline Daniels and Matshipi Marcia Letsoalo returning two wickets each. Fargana Hoque did her best to hold the innings together, hitting 67 runs from 144 deliveries, but wickets tumbled around her. Skipper Dane van Niekerk was delighted with the team’s result and credited her batters for setting up the innings when required and the bowlers for their consistency throughout. “We’re very happy to clinch the series and not take it all the way to the fifth game,” she said. “Our batters showed some responsibility and resilience and took us to a really good score. Everybody chipped in to get us there. “Our bowlers have been our pride and joy for the last few seasons and, hopefully they can continue in the same way throughout.” Cricket SA
