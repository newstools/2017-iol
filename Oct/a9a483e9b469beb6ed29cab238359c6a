Following a standout performance in Las Vegas to mark the launch of the PUMA x XO debut collection, Abel Tesfaye a.k.a. The Weeknd and PUMA officially announce the release date of the second drop. The follow up to the sell-out PUMA x XO Parallel that dropped in August, the next release features an Olive-Green colourway of the sneaker boot complimenting a range of apparel dubbed “Deluxe Denim”. Won’t be long until fans get their hands on the covetable denim pieces that The Weeknd has been stunting at his Legend of the Fall World Concert Tour. The collection remains a true reflection of his personal style merged with PUMA’s sport-inspired silhouettes. Raw and destroyed denim and contemporary street inspired oversized silhouettes are this drop’s recurring theme. Notable pieces are the PUMA x XO Denim Jacket with frayed details on the front and back with subtle PUMA x XO branding, statement Denim Kimono with tapered sleeves and frayed hem and the PUMA x XO Denim Pants with distressed pockets and back lower leg length. The denim look extends to accessories with the PUMA x XO Denim Duffle and Denim Cap. Signature XO silhouettes compliment the rough and rugged pieces, from the PUMA x XO Hoodie with an all-new camo pattern to Tees and Tanks that bear the PUMA x XO logo. Rounding up the capsule range is the PUMA x XO Parallel in the latest Olive Green colourway.  Inspired by military and utilitarian gear, the PUMA x XO Parallel is a mid-cut sneaker boot that’s fully decked out in luxurious Italian nubuck leather upper. The smooth rubber midsole features IGNITE cushioning technology. The boot boasts of a contemporary blocked heel design with an extended Formstripe and co-branded labels.   The second drop of the PUMA x XO Parallel is now available PUMA SELECT, Shelflife and X-Trend stores. Follow @PUMASouthAfrica, @PUMASportstyle and @PUMA for drop information and all things #PUMAXO
