Cape Town A Gugulethu mother is distraught that her one-year-old son needs a liver transplant and even if he gets one he may not live for long. It is very painful for me to know when my child will die and to go in and out of hospitals, Siyanda Tafeni said.Tafeni said she was in the Eastern Cape and had to give birth to her son Babalwa because six months into her pregnancy he had stopped growing. I had to give birth immediately; after that my child started getting sick, she said.He would cry when touched, an emotional Tafeni told the Cape Argus. He was better after an operation in the Eastern Cape but Siyanda s stomach kept growing and she knew there was something still wrong with him.She decided to move to Cape Town and her baby was checked at a local clinic. He was referred to Red Cross Hospital. On arrival at the Red Cross I was told that my son needed a new liver. I was asked where we live and I explained that my family is in a one-room shack, said Tafeni.The hospital told her even if the operation was successful, Siyanda would not live for long because of their living conditions. I was told we need a formal house with running water and an indoor toilet if my son is to survive after he gets the liver transplant, she said.The ward councillor was approached to help with getting a proper house but to no avail, she said.Provincial department of health spokesperson Darren Francis said: A team of specialists have been treating the patient and they have given the best possible care. We are however unfortunately not able to assist the patient with a transplant at this point as there are a lack of donors internationally. The management at the hospital is doing their utmost. There is an average of over 4 300 adults and children at any given time, waiting for a life-saving organ transplant, in South Africa, said Francis. siyabonga.kalipa@inl.co.zaCape Argus
