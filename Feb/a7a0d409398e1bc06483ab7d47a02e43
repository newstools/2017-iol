Football club Kaizer Chiefs has signed a partnership with Toyota South Africa Motors to become Amakhosi's official vehicle supplier. The deal lasts for an initial three years and will see the Japanese carmaker supplying the popular premier league club, which has an estimated 20 million supporters, with 20 vehicles to meet all Kaizer Chiefs' transportation requirements. The fleet, all branded in the trademark Amakhosi black-and-gold colours, ranges from hatchbacks, sedans, and SUVs, bakkies to panel vans and minibuses. "Toyota is one of the biggest motor vehicle manufacturers in the world and their brand is synonymous with quality and reliability across the globe," comments Kaizer Chiefs Executive Chairman, Kaizer Motaung."These attributes resonate deeply with Kaizer Chiefs, as we are a club that aspires to the same ideals and high standards." Andrew Kirby, Chief Executive Officer and President of Toyota South Africa, says the Toyota brand is deeply rooted in South African sport. "Whether it is rugby, cycling, motorsport and now soccer â€“ we are behind South African sport wholeheartedly. We are excited about joining the Amakhosi fans in supporting their team and hope to grow this partnership over time," he says. Amakhosi supporters will benefit from this new deal too as Kaizer Chiefs and Toyota have allocated 250 free and secure parking bays for Toyota drivers attending Kaizer Chiefs home matches at Jozi's FNB stadium. This area will be known as the Toyota Zone and supporters will be allocated parking on a first-come, first-serve basis. Supporters are encouraged to attend home games and arrive early so they can enjoy this exclusive benefit.
