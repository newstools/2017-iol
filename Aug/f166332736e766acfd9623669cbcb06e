BIRMINGHAM – England hammered the West Indies by an innings and 209 runs as the inaugural day-night Test in Britain ended inside three days at Edgbaston on Saturday. West Indies, following on, were bowled out for 137 in their second innings as they lost 19 wickets in total during the day’s play. Victory gave England a 1-0 lead in a three-match series that continues with the second Test at Headingley starting on Friday. England had established a commanding position thanks to Alastair Cook’s 243 and the opener’s stand of 248 with captain Joe Root (136) as the some side piled up 514/8 declared. West Indies slumped to 168 all out in reply, with only Jermaine Blackwood (79 not out) offering much resistance. Root enforced the follow-on, with West Indies 346 runs behind, and the tourists promptly collapsed again. Stuart Broad took three wickets for four runs in 11 balls, including two in two, as he surpassed Ian Botham’s tally of 383 Test wickets and moved into second place in England’s all-time list behind long-standing new-ball partner James Anderson.
