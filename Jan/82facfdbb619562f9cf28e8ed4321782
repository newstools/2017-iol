Banyana Banyana gave it all they had, but were ultimately outlasted 2-0 by France in an international friendly in Saint-Denis, Reunion on Sunday night. Central defender Griedge Mbock Bathy scored both goals in the first 34 minutes to put the South Africans on the back foot, from which Desiree Ellis’ charges never recovered. France are ranked third in the world, with South Africa 51st, and the gulf in class was evident early on as Bathy grabbed the opener in the ninth minute. She followed it up with her second in the 34th, but the South Africans will be pleased that they didn’t conceded any further goals. The first match between the two countries saw the French triumph 3-2 in 2009. Captain Janine van Wyk took to Twitter on Sunday night to express her delight with taking on a world power in women’s football. “What another fantastic experience playing against a TOP team. The result wasn’t in our favour but we gave our best. Well done team”
