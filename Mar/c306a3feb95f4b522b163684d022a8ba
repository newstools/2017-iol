Ship Bottom, New Jersey - A New Jersey police officer has helped a dying woman fulfill her final wish of going to the beach one last time. Seventy-eight-year-old Pat Kelly, of Burlington City, has a terminal diagnosis of acute leukemia and is in hospice care. So on a weekend trip to Long Beach Island, Officer Ron Holloway drove Kelly to the water's edge. Kelly called it her last "hurrah." She said after she dies, she'd like for her ashes to be scattered on the beach. Holloway says it was "a life-moving experience" to be able to help Kelly fulfill her dying wish. Associated Press
