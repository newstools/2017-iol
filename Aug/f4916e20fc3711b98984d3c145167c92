JOHANNESBURG – Phakamani Mahlambi is staying put at Bidvest Wits despite interest locally and internationally. Wits chief executive Jose Ferreira confirmed this at the Premier Soccer League offices on the last day of the transfer window. “We had offers from lots of clubs, overseas and locally,” Ferreira said. “But at this point in time, it seems that the more interesting offers are coming from overseas. “There was nothing concrete at all on Phakamani. There’s been interest and we have listened to the interest, but as I stand here before you, there is nothing to discuss on Phakamani Mahlambi. “He is a Bidvest Wits player and will continue to be a Bidvest Wits player, until something happens – if something happens. “We also finalised the Liam Jordan move to Sporting Lisbon. He is there for another season, with an option to buy.” The Clever Boys loaned out Sifiso Myeni to SuperSport United on a season-long loan in the club’s last activity before the transfer window closed at midnight. The deal was finalised late on Thursday afternoon. It will see Myeni reunite with coach Eric Tinkler, with whom he worked at Orlando Pirates. “This is a new chapter that I am embarking on,” Myeni said. “I need to work hard to make sure that I help a winning team. I am joining a winning team, which means that I must also add my experience. “It’s a good move for me because I will be working with someone that I know. But that doesn’t mean that since I know the coach and worked with him for a number of years, I will have it easy and take my foot off the pedal. “Benni (McCarthy) (coach of Cape Town City) was interested in me at one stage. We spoke when we were in camp in Cape Town, but nothing materialised.” @NJABULON  IOL Sport
