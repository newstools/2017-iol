The Panorama Route is a stretch of road in Mpumalanga that links the majority of the province's most breath taking sites.Â The route starts at the foot of theÂ Long Tom PassÂ just outsideÂ Lydenburg, following the natural descent from theÂ Great EscarpmentÂ to theÂ Lowveld, and ending at the border of theÂ MpumalangaÂ andÂ LimpopoÂ provinces near theÂ Echo Caves. The route also hosts the largest man-made forest of pine and eucalyptus plantations that stretch along the route. The drive itself is therapeutic, not to mention beautiful.

On the day we visited locals who told us we were lucky that the area was not completely covered by mist, a stroll away from the Canyon are the Three Rondavels. The mountain formation was created due to erosion. The soft underlying tone of the rock came away and the slate and quartzite shaped the rock formation. The legend behind the formation is that they were named after a Bapedi chief who defeated the Swazis in war.Â The flat-topped peak was named Mapjaneng ('the chief') after a legendary Bapedi chief,Â Maripi Mashile, while the three peaks are named after his three wives (from left to right) â€“ Magabolie, Mogoladikwe and Maseroto. Bourke's Luck Potholes  An extremely spiritual site, the potholes were formed by years of flowing water. The site is named afterÂ a prospector, Tom Bourke, who hoped to find gold at this site. He was unsuccessful, but other prospectors had more luck in the area. The Treur River meets Blyde River at this site, and locals have named these rivers the river of sadness and the river of happiness, and believe if they wash their feet in the river, their fortunes will change. If you look to the bottom of the clear water, you see hundreds of coins that were thrown into the water as visitors made a wish. Be prepared for a little walk though, its a beautiful experience that's worth it.
