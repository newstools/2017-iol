CAPE TOWN – False Bay beat College Rovers 30-18 (halftime 20-10) in the Gold Cup final in Constantia on Saturday to claim their maiden national club title. The well-earned victory in front of 4 500 spectators made up for last year’s loss in the final to Rustenburg Impala. Rovers, the KZN champions, put on a brave performance on a hot, windless afternoon. The Bay were under the cosh early on which cost them three points, but they owned the park for much of the half and cashed in with three tries. The first was dotted down by left wing Danie Roux, the second by right wing Marcello Sampson, which fullback Adnaan Osman converted, before one went the way of star flank Taps Tsmondo, giving the home side a comfortable 17-3 lead. Rovers flyhalf Chris Jordaan made a break and deposited the ball under the posts, then added the extras to narrow the deficit to 10 points going into half-time. The second half was a battle between the 22's with both packs putting in big hits and not willing to give an inch. Bay cancelled out Rovers’ penalty goal before Roux created and rounded off Bay’s fourth try, the successful conversion making it 30-13. Rovers had to wait until the final minute for their next points, an unconverted try by substitute Grant Rattray. Points-Scorers False Bay – Tries: Danie Roux (2), Marcello Sampson, Taps Tsmondo.
