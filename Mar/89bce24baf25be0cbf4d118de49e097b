The unit inched close to its firmest level in a week, helped by steadying commodity prices and strong demand for bonds. By 5.40pm, the rand had strengthened to R12.99 to the dollar from an overnight close of R13.01, outperforming a number of its emerging market peers as it rallied to its best level since March 2 mid-session. The economy contracted 0.3 percent in the final three months of last year as mining and manufacturing output shrank, reigniting concerns about falling government revenues and the countryâ€™s chances of holding on to its investment rate credit rating. Bonds rallied, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026, falling. Reuters
