The 26-year-old has been training with the Soweto club for the last few weeks and is said to have made enough of a positive impression to earn a contract. His imminent signing may spell the end of the Chiefs careers of Edward Manqele and Siphelele Mthembu. It's thought the club are in the process of securing Paez’s work permit, although for now, all Chiefs Football Manager Bobby Motaung was offering on the matter is to confirm that the club has signed a foreign player. "We have signed one and we will make other announcements; [he] is from outside [the country]," Motaung said on the weekend. Born in Venezuela to Italian parents, Paez was part of the Venezuelan squad for the 2007 South American Under-17 Football Championship but has not featured for the national team since. He has drifted around during his career, playing in Peru, Venezuela and Slovenia, and in the lower divisions in Italy and Spain. While Paez is lacking in top class credentials, it's interesting to note that he played for the same club in his home country – Estudiantes de Mérida, as Jose Torrealba, the latter having enjoyed a relatively successful time in the PSL with Mamelodi Sundowns and then Chiefs. Another South American marksman who also arrived in the PSL as a relative unknown is Leonardo Castro, who has contributed significantly to Sundowns' cause. Chiefs have struggled to find a reliable goal scorer over the last few seasons and the two Zimbabwean marksmen and one Zambian striker they brought in before the start of the current campaign have just one goal in 23 combined league games. A large portion of their goals in recent seasons have been netted by midfielders such as George Lebese, Willard Katsande and Siphiwe Tshabalala. Despite their lack of firepower, Chiefs find themselves in fourth position on the standings, just a point adrift of joint leaders SuperSport United, Bidvest Wits and Cape Town City.
