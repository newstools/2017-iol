If you loved their last Kimono range of pop art, you are in for a treat as their spring collection is  inspired by the biggest trend of the year the pyjama trend! Black kimono by Zamaan. Picture: Instagram. These luxury kimonos are designed in high-end Zamaan-designed  fabrics and are beautifully hand-embellished with bugs and birds (another big international trend among design houses like Dolce & Gabbana and Dior). According to New York, London and Paris runways, sleepwear is the new daywear. So how do you master the pyjama trend without looking like you just rolled out of bed? ELEGANT Pair up with the latest Zamaan kimono with a pair of jeans and white tee...teamed up with a pair of slides and you're good to go! EFFORTLESS For a more leisure lunch look with your girlfriends, pair up with your favourite denims, a dressier top and a pair of ankle boots. STYLISH You can even wear this look to a semi-formal engagement by styling it with a tulle and metallic shoe. FORMAL Finally, to transform this kimono into a more formal look, pair up with an LBD or full black number.  Zamaan kimonos are multi-functional high end designer pieces that won’t break the bank, but certainly break the rules in the fashion industry!  This bespoke limited edition range is available in selected boutiques. Connect with Zamaan through their social media handles @zamaan_sa and their website zamaan.co.za
