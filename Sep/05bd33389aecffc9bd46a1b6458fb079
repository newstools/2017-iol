Bloemfontein - The Supreme Court of Appeal will on Thursday hear President Jacob Zuma and the National Prosecuting Authority's (NPA) appeal against a High Court ruling relating to the spy tapes saga The appeal follows a ruling in April last year, in which a judge ordered a review of a 2009 decision by the NPA to set aside hundreds of charges against Zuma, describing the original ruling as “irrational”. This effectively reinstated the 783 fraud, racketeering, and corruption charges controversially withdrawn by former NPA head Mokotedi Mpshe, paving the way for Zuma to become president in 2009. Both the president and the NPA then approached the SCA after the high court refused the request to appeal. The SCA granted the request and gave Zuma and the NPA until June 5 to file their heads of argument. The DA's James Selfe in a statement confirmed that the matter would be heard on September 14-15 in Bloemfontein. "It is this leave to appeal that will be heard by the SCA after nearly eight and a half years after we first filed papers in this case," Selfe said. Selfe confirmed that the matter will begin at 10am. IOL
