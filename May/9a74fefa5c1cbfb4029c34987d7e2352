For hours, there were various speculations and rumours such as the death of Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip, Prince Harry's engagement and that the Queen might take back America. Earlier, a Buckingham Palace official told The Associated Press that a meeting of royal household staff had been called, but that there is "no cause for concern." Of course, the speculations did not come near to the truth, which is that HRH The Duke of Edinburgh has decided that he will no longer carry out public engagements.    #BuckinghamPalace When you finally see what the meeting was about and you stayed up all night pic.twitter.com/pXezoWaORd  — D.T.
