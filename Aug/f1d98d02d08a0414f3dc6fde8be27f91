DURBAN - A gang of robbers, armed with hammers struck a jewellery counter inside Game at the City View shopping centre in Greyville on Wednesday, sparking fears that the notorious "hammer gang" were making a comeback after intense police pressure in recent months. "The men had smashed the glass doors and then ransacked the jewellery counter," said Kyle van Reenen, Marshall Security spokesperson “It is alleged yesterday at 9.10pm, the victim (a security guard) was at the business premises when three unknown suspects entered the store. At gunpoint the suspects robbed the victim of cellphone, wallet, jewellery and TV sets before fleeing the crime scene on foot,” said Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane. The police are appealing to anyone who might have information about the men, to contact the local police or their Crime Stop on 08600 10111. Zwane said a case of business robbery is being investigated by Durban Central police. Meanwhile, after 6am on Thursday morning, robbers tried to gain entry at Silver People, which sells sterling silver products, in Davenport Square. Bruce Jacobsohn, owner of Silver People said three men tried to smash the door. "But luckily security saw them and they fled the scene,” he said. At the beginning of the year, a gang using hammers targetted several jewellery stores across KwaZulu-Natal. Police set up a provincial mall robbery task team to investigate the incidents and July made a breakthrough when two men, one of whom is believed to be the "kingpin" were arrested in Umlazi. The man was expected to appear in court on Thursday for a bail application. Daily News
