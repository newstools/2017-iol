Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West are set to launch a children's clothing range.   The 36-year-old 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star has revealed her and her 39-year-old husband have started creating a new fashion line for kids, and the television personality showcased a few of the garments from the capsule, which was modelled by their three-year-old child North, on social media.   The raven-haired beauty who also has 13-month-old son Saint with her spouse posted a string of short videos of her daughter in a yellow sequin dress, which was paired with a shearling coat, white socks and black trainers, on her Snapchat.
