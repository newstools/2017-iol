Sean Joubert has been appointed as chief executive of the integrated tourism group Tourvest from 1 January 2018.  He succeeds Tommy Edmond, who retires at the end of the year.
 
Joubert, 50, is currently the chief operations officer of Quintica, a UK-registered company which streamlines and automates business processes and workflows. Before that, he was chief financial officer of Dimension Data MEA (Middle East and Africa) and managing director of the Dimension Data Systems Integration Business for MEA.  Educated at the University of Johannesburg, he is a chartered accountant by profession.
 
Announcing this, Tourvest chairman Robert Gumede said that with his technological background, solid mergers and acquisition experience, and proven record in building businesses in South Africa and elsewhere in Africa, Joubert would be an invaluable asset to Tourvest.
 
Gumede said: “I would also like to thank Tommy for leading Tourvest’s phenomenal growth into a major global integrated tourism group.  He leaves behind a business that is in excellent shape and a highly competent management team.”
