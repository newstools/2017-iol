Davos Nigeria's Vice President, Oluyemi Osinbajo, on Tuesday moved to dismiss notions that the relationship between his country and South Africa the two largest economies on the continent had soured. Reacting to a question at the 47th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Osinbajo was at pains to point out that there was &quot;not any kind of hostility&quot;. Referencing the MTN case which saw the Johannesburg-based telecoms company initially fined a record $5.2 billion for failure to disconnect 5.1 million unregistered customers in the country on time, Osinbajo said that that individual cases did not amount to a souring of relations between the two nations. After lengthy negotiations, MTN's fine was eventually reduced to $1,7 billion to be paid over a period of three years. MTN is Africa's biggest cellular phone company, and Nigeria its biggest market. &quot;MTN was a violation of regulations, not an arbitrary imposition of a fine,&quot; Osinbajo said, adding that the company had been party to developing the regulations. &quot;They were given sufficient time to rectify or modify conduct,&quot; he added. &quot;MTN has not complained of unfair treatment. &quot;There is not any kind of hostility. MTN has been in Nigeria for about 16 years and doing very well, and continues to do very well.&quot; African News Agency
