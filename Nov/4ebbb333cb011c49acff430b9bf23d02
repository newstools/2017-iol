Hong Kong - Infiniti has released the first picture of its all-new QX50 ahead of its world debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show next week. Built on an all-new platform, and featuring a rather distinctive, chiselled design, the new SUV also marks the debut of the world’s first "production ready" variable-compression-ratio engine. The engine uses a multi-link system to continuously raise or lower the pistons’ reach to vary the compression ratio between 8:1 when maximum performance is needed and 14:1 under calmer conditions when efficiency is desired. Mated to a CVT gearbox, the 2-litre turbocharged engine produces 200kW and 380Nm and is available in front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive configurations. The newcomer will be offered with Nissan’s ProPilot semi-autonomous driving technologies, which assist with acceleration, braking and steering during single-lane freeway driving. Infiniti says the new QX50 is the most important vehicle that it has ever introduced and given how popular premium SUVs are becoming these days, it is likely to become the Japanese brand’s best seller. At this stage the QX50 has not been confirmed, nor ruled out, for the South African market. The Nissan-owned brand is currently selling its vehicles by special order only. IOL Motoring
