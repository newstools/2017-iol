Colin Ackermannâ€™s unbeaten half-century ensured the Warriors were well-placed after a rain-hit opening day of their Sunfoil Series encounter against the Knights at the Diamond Oval in Kimberley on Monday. The right-hander struck 76 not out (135 balls, 11x4, 2x6) to take his side to an early close on 120/2 after they won the toss and opted to bat first in the Northern Cape. Only 40 overs were sent down after a wet outfield initially delayed the start, before rain returned later in the afternoon to further hamper the progress of the game. The Warriors began the round-five encounter by losing their in-form opener, Eddie Moore, to Marchant de Lange (1/21) in the opening over for a four-ball duck. Fellow opener Gionne Koopman (22) added 50 for the second wicket alongside Ackermann, before he fell to Werner Coetsee (1/31). Another in-form man, Yaseen Vallie (21), then knuckled down alongside the visiting No 3 batsman Ackermann, sharing an unbroken 60-run stand that took them to the early close. Cricket South Africa
