Misano Adriatico, Italy - Yamaha has ruled out replacing injured Valentino Rossi at this weekend's San Marino Grand Prix at Misano. The MotoGP team said on Monday Maverick Vinales would be its sole rider at the eastern Italian track. Rossi, whose title hopes are effectively over, had surgery on his broken right leg last week and left hospital on Saturday. Doctors have said the Italian, fourth in the overall standings and 26 points behind leading compatriot Andrea Dovizioso, will need 30-40 days' rest. Six MotoGP races remain and Rossi looks set to miss the next one after Misano, at Spain's Motorland Aragon circuit on 24 September as well, although he has vowed to return as soon as possible. Rossi broke his right leg in In 2010, during practice for the Italian Grand Prix and took six weeks to return. Reuters  Like us on Facebook
