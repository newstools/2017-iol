DURBAN – Royal Eagles have appointed Zipho Dlangalala as the caretaker coach while they continue with their search for a new boss. Eagles fired Allan Freese after a string of poor results. The KwaZulu-Natal side, who are competing in the National First Division (NFD), are sitting second from bottom on the log. Eagles lost twice and drew twice under Freese, who joined the side towards the end of last season. Under Freese, Eagles lost to Highlands Park and University of Pretoria, and drew against Uthongathi and Stellenbosch FC. Owen da Gama and Serame Letsoaka are on the radar of Eagles. Independent Media has gathered that the club owner appointed Dlangalala as the caretaker coach. “Sbu Mpisane, the chairman of the team, is a big fan of tiki-taka football. Zipho is known for that brand of football. He went for him as an assistant coach because he is cheap. He wants to see whether he can bring results in the next few matches,” a highly-placed source said. “He is considering other CVs. Da Gama and Serame are leading the race, but the problem is that they won’t come cheap, which is why Sbu wants to gamble with Dlangalala.” Dlangalala has been in the game for a while, and has worked with the development sides of Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates. He has also served as an assistant coach to Dan Malesela at Chippa United, and last season coached the Pirates Diski Challenge side. An attempt to get comment from Eagles general manager James Dlamini proved futile as his phone rang unanswered. @minenhlecr7  IOL Sport
