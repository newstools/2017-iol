Polokwane - Police in Westenburg outside Polokwane in Limpopo have launched a manhunt for the suspects who shot and killed an elderly woman. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe' Ngoepe said that on Tuesday at around 7pm, an elderly woman was with her domestic worker in Nirvana just outside the city when an armed suspect opened fire on them. "The old lady was rushed to hospital for medical attention where she passed on few hours later and the domestic worker did not sustain any injuries," Ngoepe said. "The deceased was identified as Mahejeen Banu Patel." According to reports, the deceased woman is the mother of Limpopo businessman Rameez Patel, who is out on bail for the alleged murder of his wife Fatima. Patel is accused of killing his wife at their Nirvana townhouse complex in Polokwane in 2005. He told the court that he was innocent and that his wife was killed by robbers. Patel is also accused of killing Westenburg resident, Tony Adams in 2013. Police say Adams was last seen entering Patel’s yard. “He was then assaulted with a hockey stick and his body dumped at a supermarket parking lot in the area,” the State alleges. Both cases are still ongoing. Rameez Patel’s father was also shot and killed last year. Police on Wednesday said that the motive behind Mahejeen Banu Patel was not immediately clear as nothing was taken from the deceased's house.
