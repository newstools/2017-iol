But in an exclusive interview in The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine today, Hollywood’s hottest actress reveals she is now ‘learning how to be alone’ in the wake of her shock separation from second husband Romain Dauriac. Scarlett, 32, hints at her heartbreak, while also talking about her twin brother Hunter. In the interview, which was conducted the day before the split from the French advertising executive became public knowledge, the New Yorker says: ‘I’ve realised in the past couple of years that I have never actually been alone. I have always been with somebody. ‘And in those first moments of life, even just the spark of it, having somebody else there must affect one, right? ‘Because of that, I’m learning now how to be alone just with myself.’ Scarlett shot to fame in 2003’s hit Lost In Translation, and she admits it is nice knowing that people fancy her, but adds: ‘For every person I meet who fancies me, there is another who thinks, “Who does she think she is?’ Her films, which also include The Other Boleyn Girl, have grossed more than £2.4?billion at the box office, putting her ahead of Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz in terms of financial pulling power.  © Daily Mail
