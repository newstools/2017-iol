Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna are back together.  The on/off couple – who have four-month-old daughter Dream together – seemingly confirmed their relationship is back on in a series of Snapchat videos on Saturday.  Chyna, 28, shared a clip of herself lip-synching 'Humble' by Kendrick Lamar, while Rob hugged her from behind, and in a second post captioned "Dreams Daddy", the 30-year-old sock designer was seen nuzzling his face into her chest.  A third video saw Chyna – who also has four-year-old son King Cairo with former partner Tyga – ask Rob to give her a kiss, prompting him to do so on her cheek.  It was revealed last month the 'Rob & Chyna' stars had been living apart and suspended filming on their reality show.  And Chyna later confirmed they weren't sharing a house any more, but insisted she was "in it for the long haul" with Rob and they had been having therapy to help repair their relationship.  She said: "I feel like every person who's in a long-term relationship, or who is committed to their person, goes through ups and downs.  "Everything isn't always going to be peaches and cream. If it is, then it's fake. I'm in it for the long haul, so I feel like my advice [for anyone in a similar situation] is therapy, know each other's family, calling each other's moms.  "I feel like everything isn't going to be perfect, but I know we love each other and we're fighting for each other, and the people we surround ourselves with are rooting for us. It makes everything much easier."  Meanwhile, insiders claimed taking a break from the relationship had been "really good" for both Rob and Chyna.  The source said: "Rob had been staying at [his mom] Kris' house with the baby while Chyna was out of town and Kris was helping him with the baby. He's in a really positive mood again.  "Everything was moving so fast with the relationship, the baby, the engagement and the show that this break has been really good for both of them."  Bang Showbiz
