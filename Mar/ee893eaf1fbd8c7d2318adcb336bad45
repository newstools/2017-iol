Durban There was a heavy police presence at Scottburgh Magistrate's Court ahead of the appearance of 22 men who are accused of being part of a cable theft syndicate. The presence of 15 police officers with helmets, shields and truncheons in the small courtroom follows the assault of two prosecutors at the men's previous appearance on January 23. The 22 had become angry at the postponement Lawyers, court orderlies and Magistrate Ambrose Mfayela fled the courtroom, leaving the two prosecutors at the mercy of the 22 men who began throwing furniture around and attacking them. A stenographer and a translator apparently came to their rescue, throwing furniture back at the attackers. The two prosecutors were hospitalised and on Monday it appeared that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had replaced them with Advocate Yuri Gangai and another prosecutor. The 22 suspects were believed to be part of a group of 26 who were arrested in 2012. The Daily News reported in September 2014 that there were 189 charges faced by the men and that investigators had needed to go though cellphone data of 1.5 million calls made between the suspects over an 18-month period. The paper further reported at the time that one of the accused, Lindinkosi Xulu, was alleged to have stolen cables from Transnet worth about R388 000. Following the theft in July 2012, a train derailed in Howick/Hilton which resulted in R57 million in damages. This also impacted on 1 700 businesses in the area. The two assaulted prosecutors, Advocate Annelize Harrison and Advocate Ayesha Bissessur,who work in the NPA s organised crime unit, had apparently long complained about concerns for their security.
