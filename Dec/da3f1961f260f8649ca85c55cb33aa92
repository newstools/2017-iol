Makes 14 to 16 pieces The ganache for chocolate truffles is typically made with heavy cream, but beer is used here instead - adding a rich, deep flavor. The truffle mixture needs to be refrigerated for 2 to 3 hours, so it sets up firmly. Ingredients 3.6 kg bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 1 cup stout 907 g salted pretzels Method Place the chopped chocolate in a large shallow heatproof bowl. Pour the stout into a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until it has reduced by half. Pour it over the chocolate. Let it sit for 2 minutes, then gently stir until smooth. Cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours, until set. Seal the pretzels in a zip-top bag. Crush them to the consistency of coarse crumbs. Line a quarter baking sheet (13-by-9-inch) with parchment paper. Use a melon baller to scoop out 1 1/4-inch wide balls of the truffle mixture (14 to 16) then coat each one with the crushed pretzels, arranging the truffles on the small baking sheet. If the truffle mixture becomes soft as you work, pop it back in the refrigerator until it is well chilled again. Cover and refrigerate the truffles to firm them up; for best flavor, let the truffles sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving.
