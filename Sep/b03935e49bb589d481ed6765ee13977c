INTERNATIONAL - German carmaker Volkswagen and its China joint ventures FAW-Volkswagen and SAIC Volkswagen will recall a total of 1.82 million vehicles in China over fuel pumps that could lead to stalling of the engines, according to the countryâ€™s top quality watchdog. The affected vehicles include 859869 domestically produced 2007 to 2014 Magotan models, 810257 domestically produced 2011 to 2015 new Passat models, and some imported models of Magotan and Volkswagen CC, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said on its website. Overheating and mechanical pressure could lead to failure of electronic components in the fuel pump control modules, causing the engines to stall, the administration said. The companies will replace the fuel pump control modules for free. The recall will start on December 25 this year. Owners of the vehicles will be informed of the recall via registered mail, according to the administration. - XINHUA
