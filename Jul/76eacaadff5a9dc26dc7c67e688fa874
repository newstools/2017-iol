Johannesburg - Absa has been granted an interim interdict order against Black Land First (BLF) that prevents the movement from protesting outside the bank's various branches. This after BLF threatened to embark on a campaign to force Absa to comply with Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's recommendations in her report on Absa's benefits from an apartheid-era deal. The movement gave Absa a five-day ultimatum to abide by the public protector's report or face the wrath of the organisation. In a series of tweets, reporter Sam Mkokeli confirmed that BLF has been interdicted from damaging Absa property, impeding staff, blocking access to branches or ATMs or intimidating staff members and clients. The movement been barred from engaging in protest action not in accordance with Gatherings Act. This latest ruling is another blow to BLF, who on Tuesday saw an interdict application filed against them, this time by the SA National Editors’ Forum (Sanef). Sanef, in court papers filed, asked the court to interdict BLF and Mngxitama from harassing, intimidating, assaulting and threatening 11 senior journalists, editors and commentators that have been targeted for their reporting on state capture. The South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg has since declared the case urgent and is set to hand down judgment on July 7  at 12pm. IOL
