"His immediate appointment by the Minister of Finance, Mr [Malusi] Gigaba, clearly demonstrates that indeed the minister has a commitment and an urgency to advance South African Economic growth," BBC president Danisa Baloyi said. National Treasury announced Mogajane's appointment on Wednesday, after Cabinet confirmed his appointment. Mogajane succeeds Lungile Fuzile who last month asked to be released from his duties a year before his contract could come to an end in May 2018 following the Cabinet reshuffle at the end of March. Mogajane, who was the deputy director-general responsible for the public finance division, had been acting in the position since Fuzileâ€™s departure. He has also been involved in the CEO Initiative, where he worked very closely with the BBC on behalf of National Treasury. BBC secretary general, George Sebulela, said Mogajane was indeed not new to the BBC. "He has been a team leader for a BBC and National Treasury committee that was appointed by former Minister Pravin Gordan to address our concerns with regards to our Radical Economic Transformation requirements that National Treasury will assist to implement," Sebulela said.
