Johannesburg - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi on Friday said disciplinary action had been taken against 12 learners who involved in violent behaviour at Norkem Park High School in Kempton Park. A number of videos went viral on social media showing learners fighting. In the video clips, a learner can be seen with a gun. Addressing learners and teachers, Lesufi said 10 girls and two boys had been suspended. "Any learner who is ill disciplined inside and outside the school should be suspended. The SGB [School Governing Body] should hold a hearing and those learners will miss exams and repeat the school year." The MEC said the situation at the school was "out of control". He said assistance had already been sought from the South African Police Services to carry out random searches at the school. "I have asked the police to get involved, this morning alone two learners assaulted two teachers," revealed Lesufi, adding that he was disappointed. One of the teachers was assaulted while the MEC was in a meeting with the principal. In another incident, a learner was found in possession of alcohol by an SGB member. Lesufi said as many 18 learners were linked to criminal gangs. African News Agency
