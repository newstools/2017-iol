JOHANNESBURG – The Board of Directors of Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Monday approved the recommendation of the national selection panel to appoint Faf du Plessis as captain of the Proteas ODI squad with immediate effect. He takes the place of AB de Villiers, who had resigned as the captain. Du Plessis will thus captain the Proteas in all three formats. “Congratulations to Faf on his appointment as the natural successor to the ODI leadership,” said CSA CEO Haroon Lorgat. “He has established himself as one of the best leaders in world cricket, and this was reflected in his appointment as the captain for the World XI currently engaged in the T20 series against Pakistan.” His first series in charge of the ODI squad will be against Bangladesh next month. Meanwhile, Aiden Markram of the Titans will lead the South Africa Invitation XI to play Bangladesh in a three-day tour match at Willowmoore Park in Benoni from September 21 to 23. “We have chosen a squad consisting largely of CSA Academy players, balanced by a few franchise players to provide the necessary experience,” said CSA National Selection Panel Convener Linda Zondi.
