JOHANNESBURG – Finally getting his breakthrough, Antonio Alkana smashed the SA and continental 110m hurdles record with a winning time of 13.11 seconds at the Josef Odloil Memorial on Monday night. Alkana has threatened to break London 2012 finalist Lehann Fourie’s record of 13.24, and came painstakingly close in Rabat last year when he stopped the clock 0.04 short of that time. The South African finished ahead of Hungary’s Balázs Baji, who posted a national record of 13.24 for second place. Alkana’s time was the joint-third fastest time for the season, which will hold him in good stead ahead of the IAAF World Championships in London in August. South African women’s 400m hurdles ace Wenda Nel made a promising start to her international campaign by winning her race with a season’s best and world qualifying time of 54.66. Commonwealth Games champion Cornel Fredericks also earned a podium finish, clocking 49.42, with Mamadou Kassé Hanne of France taking the spoils in 49.02. Compatriot Lindsey Hanekom finished fifth with a season’s best of 50.63 in only his second race of the year. South Africa's second fastest 100m sprinter Thando Roto raced home in third place, clocking 10.15, with Mosito Lehata of Lesotho winning in a time of 10.11.    @ockertde The Star   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
