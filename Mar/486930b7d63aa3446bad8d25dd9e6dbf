New Zealand's squad will remain unchanged for the third Test against South Africa in Hamilton despite the mauling the Black Caps received in Wellington, chief selector Gavin Larsen said Monday. Larsen ruled out an overhaul after New Zealand slumped to an eight-wicket loss within three days in the second Test in Wellington, insisting the country's best players were already in the squad. "We've got 100 percent faith in the fact that we've got what we think is the best group of Test cricketers in the country and a Test match to win in Hamilton," he told reporters. Larsen said strike bowler Trent Boult, who missed the second Test with a sore leg, was hopeful about starting in Hamilton on Saturday. But he said batting stalwart Ross Taylor was expected to miss another Test as he recovers from a calf tear.
