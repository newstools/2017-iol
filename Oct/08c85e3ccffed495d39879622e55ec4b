But for the latest beauty trend, stars are turning not to a new invention but something that's been around for more than 2000 years: acupuncture. The ancient practice, a staple of Chinese medicine, has been credited for treating everything from chronic pain to fertility problems. Now A-listers are trying the procedure, which is said to reduce fine lines and puffiness. Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston have tried out “cosmetic facial acupuncture” in the US, while Millie Mackintosh has given it a go in the UK. The former Made In Chelsea star, 28, swears by the painful-sounding procedure, in which up to 40 needles are inserted into the face, ears and neck and left for around 45 minutes. She claims regular £95 (about R1 700)  treatments have improved her appearance as well as helping her to beat headaches. Mackintosh, a descendant of the Quality Street chocolate makers, said that after having acupuncture for back pain, she tried it on her face, adding: “It's been amazing. It has stopped me getting headaches. “The appearance of my skin was smoother afterwards as well; it really does work on fine lines. It also drains fluid where they place the needles by encouraging the lymph to drain to flush out puffiness in the face.  - Daily Mail
