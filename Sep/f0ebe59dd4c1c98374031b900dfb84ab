Londonners wanting a local meal before they depart from Heathrow Airport can try Gordon Ramsay's Plane Food at Terminal 5. The newly revamped restaurant will include an Asian bar where guests can watch as chefs prepare their meals and the Grab and Go option that offers travellers the chance to take a pre-cooked meal to eat while they are 40 000 feet in the air.  The restaurant menu features British classics with a twist. Ramsey is adding some of his British influences to the menu, offering travellers a short rib beef burger, braised british lamb and a steamed sea bass, mint crushed new potatoes and courgette pesto. Dessert lovers can tuck into an Eton mess and sticky toffee pudding with clotted cream. If you travelling with your little ones, the meal is free and they can choose from Matilda Ramsay’s Tilly Treats Menu. Plane Food opened in 2008 and changed the face of airport dining. It was known as the only full service dining restaurant at Heathrow and Ramsay’s first restaurant at an airport. On the website, Ramsay said that Plane Food has been setting the standard for airport dining since 2008. “It has brought together the group’s passion for high quality food, amazing flavours and service. “I am excited for travellers to experience the new, modern Plane Food that has been inspired by influences from all over the globe…”
