The driver was shot in an alleged armed robbery in Nyanga East on Saturday evening. The bus drove through two houses, miraculously not killing anybody else. Golden Arrow Bus Services spokesperson Brownwen Dyke-Beyer said the driver lost control of his vehicle after he was shot. “Golden Arrow can confirm an incident in Nyanga East on Saturday evening. One of our drivers was tragically killed. “According to the information available at this stage, the driver was shot during an attempted robbery and subsequently lost control of the vehicle and collided with two homes. “Two passengers on the bus were transported to hospital to be treated for minor injuries. Our driver succumbed to his injuries on the scene,” Dyke-Beyer said. It is believed the bus was en route to Wynberg when the driver was approached by unknown assailants. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said police are investigating. No arrests had been made. Dyke-Beyer condemned the murder. “Golden Arrow condemns this senseless act in the strongest possible terms. We will do everything in our power to assist the SAPS to apprehend the perpetrators of this crime. “We send our most sincere condolences to his family during this very difficult time. We will be providing support and assistance. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of one our own and he will be sorely missed by his colleagues,” she said. Nyanga CPF chairperson Martin Makasi also condemned the killing. “According to information, the assailants got in the bus after shooting the driver and tried to pickpocket him while he was dying. We are not sure if anything was taken. “We hope the police work effectively on this case because one of the two suspects is terrorising the community after he was released from jail. “We commend the community for giving information to the police to ensure the arrest of this culprit,” Makasi said.
