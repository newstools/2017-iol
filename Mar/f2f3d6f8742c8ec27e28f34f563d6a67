JOHANNESBURG – Regarding the appointment of a new Springbok captain, coach Allister Coetzee said it was not simply a matter of picking someone in place of the now internationally retired Adriaan Strauss. “It’s a big challenge,” said Coetzee when asked on Sunday – at the start of the first of three national training camps – about the need to find a new team leader. “We’ve lost a lot of leaders and senior players since the 2015 World Cup, men like Victor Matfield, Jean de Villiers, Schalk Burger, Fourie du Preez... and others who’re now playing overseas. There’s over 500 caps gone, and it’s left a bit of a void. “The thing is we’re sitting with a young group of Boks... there are some players who’ve played a few Tests, but most of the guys are under 26. In terms of leadership, we have a young group. “The captaincy matter is not clear-cut. Names are not popping up... there are ifs and buts, even if you had to decide on the captain – is he the best, is he a starter, will he be accepted by a big group? “There is a process I’ll follow, but I’ll appoint a captain well before the June Tests.” The favourites to lead the team are Warren Whiteley, Beast Mtawarira, Pat Lambie, Handré Pollard, Siya Kolisi and from overseas Duane Vermeulen. Even Lood de Jager has been mentioned as a dark horse. @jacq_west
