Chengdu, Sichuan Province - These are the first official images of the Maserati Ghibli GranLusso, just ahead of its world premiere at the Chengdu Motor Show today. It’s the first significant update of Maserati’s compact sports sedan since its introduction four years ago, aimed at bringing its styling in line with more recent models from Modena. Thus it sports a new, more angular grille with chrome bars, over a deeper front bumper with chrome trim strips, matched to body colour side skirts and a completely redesigned rear bumper with a body-colour diffuser for a crisp new look, as well as a ‘substantial improvement’ (Maserati’s words) in the airflow at the back of the car. Oh, and don‘t forget the ‘GranLusso’ badges just behind each front wheel - good for at least another 5km/h, they are. On a slightly more serious note, the GranLusso gets all-new adaptive full LED headlights with glare-free matrix high beams, and a raft of active driver aids enabling it to take over some of the driving chores and bring it, albeit tentatively, into the world of autonomous driving.
