Ingredients 8 lamb chops 3 tsp ras el hanout 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp olive oil Zest and juice of 1 lemon 1 sprig rosemary, finely chopped ½ small pack mint, to garnish Pinch sea salt (to taste) Pinch black pepper (to taste) Cauliflower tabbouleh ½ cauliflower ½ medium cucumber, 2 tbsp. pistachios, shelled 2 preserved lemons, chopped 15g mint, roughly chopped 20g flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped 20g coriander, roughly chopped 1 lemon, juice only 1 tsp. pomegranate molasses 1 tsp sumac Pinch sea salt (to taste) Pinch black pepper (to taste) Method Put the lamb chops in a large bowl. Add the ras el hanout, garlic, oil, most of the lemon juice, rosemary and some seasoning. Toss everything together and set aside for at least 15 mins (longer the better). While the lamb is marinating, make the tabbouleh. Grate the cauliflower and place into a medium sized bowl. Chop the cucumber into quarters and add to the bowl. Crush the pistachios roughly with the back of a knife and add to the bowl. Then, add all the herbs and toss well. Onto the dressing. Mix the remaining ingredients, pour over the cauliflower mixture and toss again. Once the meat has marinated, heat a griddle or grill until very hot and cook the lamb chops for 3-4 mins each side, until cooked but still pink and juicy on the inside, then leave to rest for a few mins. To serve, scoop the cauliflower rice into a large pan (something like a paella pan works well) and place the lamb chop chops on top. Scatter over mint leaves, open up a bottle of wine and away you go. Recipe from Ali Alt at Baliboosta.com
