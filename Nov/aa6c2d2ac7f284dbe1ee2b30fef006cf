After Cape Town City were forced to move a PSL home game to Durban, Ajax Cape Town have followed suit. The Urban Warriors announced on Thursday afternoon that they will play their Absa Premiership fixture against Chippa United at the Bidvest Stadium in Johannesburg on December 9. “It is with great regret that due to matters beyond our control we as Ajax Cape Town, the premier club in the Mother City, have to move our upcoming home game against Chippa United – scheduled for Saturday 9 December 2017 – to Bidvest Stadium, in Johannesburg,” Ajax said in a statement. “The Athlone Stadium authorities have suspended football activities at the facility until further notice, and due to the upcoming Sevens tournament at the iconic Cape Town Stadium – set to take place on 9 and 10 December 2017 – we have been forced to take our home match elsewhere. “As one can imagine, this is a far from ideal situation, and we want to take this opportunity to apologise to the #UrbanWarriors faithful.   “We’d also like to take this opportunity to thank Bidvest Wits and Wits University for availing their ground at the 11th hour for our use. It is highly appreciated. “Ajax Cape Town would also like to thank the Athlone municipality, who went out of their way to accommodate our recent clash against AmaZulu, during the severe drought which has affected millions of people across the Western Cape region.” Cape Town City will face Maritzburg United at the Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu next Tuesday, December 5, also due to a lack of suitable venues in the Mother City.
