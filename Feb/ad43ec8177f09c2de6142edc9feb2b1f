Is your little one hitting milestones? Marchelle Abrahams reports While milestones are not hard and fast rules, they are a fair indicator of how children should be developing in direct relation to the tasks they are able to execute. Educators, therapists and medical professionals can be used as a guideline to ensure a child is developmentally on track, says Justine Schapers, psychologist and therapeutic head at Birdwood Remedial School in Durban.

It can inform the type of toys you buy and the conversations you have with your little one.
