Rustenburg - North West premier Supra Mahumapelo is shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of Kgosi Simon Molatlhegi Nawa, his office said on Monday. "Saddening about Kgosi Nawa’s death is that while he was with us this past Friday at the Bokone Bophirima Maize Cup gala dinner and on Saturday during the soccer tournament, there was no indication from him that he was not feeling well. I am truly shocked," Mahumapelo said. Nawa from Lebotlwane village in the Moretele local municipality died on Sunday night. He was also the chairperson of the house of traditional leaders in Bojanala District. Mahumapelo said Kgosi Nawa was a committed leader who had the community’s best interest at heart “In him the province has lost a great and loyal leader. May his soul rest in peace." Funeral arrangements would be announced in due course. African News Agency
