If not, would you ever book a winter holiday to the Arctic?❄️🎄 A post shared by  Lily ✈ Globetrotter | Blogger (@lilyslensonlife) on Dec 19, 2017 at 12:00pm PST  “Visiting the ‘real’ home of Santa Clause, snowmobiling and skiing through one of the most beautiful landscapes I’ve seen, and ending my days with a traditional Finnish log cabin sauna and a cup of hot cocoa by the fire — it was the ultimate pre-Christmas experience.” (sic) We agree, that is what a true Christmas experience should be.
