Weâ€™ve all seen that lunatic that takes impossibly tight gaps while weaving between lanes. He always manages to calculate the move down to the last millimetre, right? Well not quite always, as this Audi A3 driver in Israel so aptly demonstrates. After clipping the car on the right the Audi flips numerous times before hitting a pole and catching fire. The driver appears to have escaped injury, and can be seen fleeing through the passenger side just before the video ends. We can only hope that a valuable lesson has been learned here.
