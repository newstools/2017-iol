The new edition is set apart on the outside by an AMG Sports Exterior package, as well as LED high performance headlights and taillights and 18-inch gloss black alloy wheels The Edition C gets its own interior trim combination of open-pore black ash and longitudinal-grain aluminium, and the model is also fitted with a flat-bottomed multifunction sports steering wheel.
