"You cannot have a situation where there are people who have land of which they don't know what to do with [it]. Others don't have a single hectare," said Zuma. "There are those who robs those of their possession and left them poor." Zuma denied that land redistribution would be done via Zimbabwe-style land grabs, saying government would be correcting the injustices of the past "within the Constitution and the law". The President did however leave the door open for law changes, saying if needs be amendments would be brought to the Constitution. "What do I want the whites to do? Let us sit down and find a solution...so there's no South Africans who have nothing while some have everything," said Zuma. "We want all South Africans to benefit from the wealth of the country, irrespective of colour or history." The man who brought up the question of what Zuma had against whites, Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenewald, then responded to Zuma, saying: "Can I say to the honourable President I accept your invitation. We can talk."  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
