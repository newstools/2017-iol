The anti-Zuma march in Polokwane would be joined by opposition parties, including the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), United Democratic Movement (UDM), and Congress of the People (COPE). Maimane's spokesman, Mabine Seabe, said President Jacob Zuma and the African National Congress (ANC) have normalised the abuse of "the people's money" and institutions for self-benefit, while neglecting their duty to create jobs and build a better South Africa. "There is no better case study than the province of Limpopo â€“ corrupted to the point of near bankruptcy, and economically stagnant," Seabe said in a statement on Monday. The march will begin at 10am at SABC Park and end at Limpopo Provincial Treasury in Polokwane. Last week opposition parties had a "National Day of Action" which brought Pretoria to a standstill when at least 120 000 of their supporters marched to the Union Buildings to intensify their calls for Zuma to step down. EFF leader Julius Malema told marchers opposition parties must build on the success of the protest and sync their efforts to oust Zuma. He also said more marches would be staged across the country.
