Tunis - A young man trying to enter the
Tunisian parliament was arrested on Tuesday when a scanner at
the entrance detected that he had a knife, officials said. The man was placed under investigation for carrying a knife
without authorisation, the interior ministry said in a
statement. According to the statement, the man said he was carrying the
knife for self-defence after being the victim of a robbery. It
said he had been invited to visit by a member of parliament. Security at the parliament building in Tunis has been
tightened since Islamist gunmen stormed the neighbouring Bardo
Museum two years ago and killed 21 foreign tourists. Reuters
