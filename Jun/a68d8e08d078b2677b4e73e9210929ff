Berlin Germany – This Friday, 16 June, will see the reveal of the all-new sixth-generation Volkswagen Polo at a special function in Berlin. No details have yet been released, but we do know that it’s based on the MQB platform and, according to Volkswagen head of design Klaus Bischoff, is sportier on the outside and more spacious inside, and features a whole raft of new technology. More important from a South African point of view is that it will be built at Volkswagen’s Uitenhage plant, and will be launched here early in 2018.
