Erftstadt, Germany – Judging by how many accessorised Ford Rangers we see on our roads, South African bakkie fans are sure to turn envious at the sight of this new piece of kit that MR Car Design has just announced in Germany. The tuner, better known for its work on performance cars, has treated the latest Ranger to a serious visual makeover as well as some engine software tuning, lifting the output of Ford’s 3.2-litre five-cylinder turbodiesel engine to 277kW and 560Nm. All mechanical and styling work is done under one roof, and in the latter instance MR has certainly gone for bold with a black and orange paint scheme, widened fenders, bold new grille, 9x18 inch wheels with appropriate ‘vet tekkies’ and a 5cm lift kit. MR also installed a dual bed cover, made of checker-plate-patterned aluminium and powder coated in matte black. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
