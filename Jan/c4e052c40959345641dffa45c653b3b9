Freinsheim – Donald Trump may have won the US presidential election, but he's having trouble winning over the people of a German village, where a bid to make him an honorary citizen is likely to fail. Councillors in Kallstadt, the quaint village in Germany's wine-making Rheinland region that was home to Trump's grandparents, have been presented with a proposal to honour the newly inaugurated president. But Mayor Thomas Jaworek put a dampener on the plans. "There is no faction that supports the proposal," he said. Germany's own Republicans, a fringe party sharing the right-wing conservative values of their US namesakes, have lodged a request to make Trump honorary citizen of Kallstadt and to even have a street or square named after him. The suggestions are to be discussed by the local council on Thursday, but Jarowek predicts that the talks will be brief. "I expect that it will be a unanimous case," he said. The municipality of Freinsheim, which includes Kallstadt, has also brushed aside a similar proposal, with a town spokesman saying Trump didn't fulfill the requirements. Trump's grandfather Friedrich – who later anglicized his name to Frederick – set out from Germany for New York in the late 1800s and later headed west as part of the Gold Rush. Friedrich sent some of his earnings back to his relatives in Germany, who used it to buy property in Kallstadt. But today there are few traces of the family that once held a stronghold there. dpa
