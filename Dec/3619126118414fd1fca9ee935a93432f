Pietermaritzburg - A cleansing ceremony covering all Durban hostels needs to be undertaken for the people that died during political clashes between the African National Congress (ANC) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the Moerane Commission on political killings in Pietermaritzburg heard on Thursday. Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini needs to oversee the ceremony, and unless the ceremony happens the killings in hostels would continue, Ubunye bamahostela deputy chairperson Mthembiseni Thusi said. Thusi issued the warning from the organisation of hostel dwellers. Ubunye bamahostela, a non- partisan organisation representing hostel dwellers from Durban, expressed concerns over the killings and insisted on a cleansing ceremony.  “We hold a view that there are lots of restless souls from the time of political violence that need to be properly rested and a cleansing ceremony will address that,” Thusi said.

Let us recall that when there were xenophobic attacks in the province he addressed an imbizo and the attacks stopped,” said Thusi.  The killings in Glebelands are mainly political as most of the members are from one political party, he said.  On Friday the National Freedom Party is expected to give evidence before the commission.
