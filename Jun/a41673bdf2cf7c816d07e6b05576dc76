Blue and white is timeless and elegant and creating your own space in this iconic colour combination is easier then ever. One doesn't have to re-do their entire space in order to incorporate this colour combination, as introductions of blue and white can complement almost any existing scheme. Add a few fabulous Chinese inspired ginger jars to a coffee or dining table along with some hydrangea flowers and silver candle holders. Put a few cushions on an arm chair in a blue striped fabric or add two statement lamps to a server with a large mirror behind it. The key is balance â€“ keep a neutral palette of furnishings and add in pops of accent colour in this truly timeless combination for a sophisticated interior. * For more inspiration go to www.netdecor.co.za
