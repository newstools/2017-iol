Pretoria A constable of the Tshwane Metro Police Department was mysteriously gunned down and killed in Hammanskraal on Monday night. Constable Eddy Solly Bokaba, 27, knocked off duty on Monday at around 11pm. He picked up a friend and travelled to the friend s place. When he arrived there, he noticed a VW Polo approaching them. He got out of his vehicle to ask what they wanted, when one person from the Polo got out and, without a word, pulled out a firearm and shot at him. It is not known how many people were in the VW vehicle. Bokaba died on the scene. Police were called. At this point we can only confirm that one of our officials has been killed. We are not sure what the motive behind the murder was. Police are still investigating, said metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba. A post-mortem would determine where and how many times Masemola was shot, he said.Mahamba could not say whether Bokaba had any enemies, or whether someone wanted him dead.No personal belongings were taken from him.Bokaba was appointed by the Tshwane Metro Police in 2012, and was part of the cable theft team. This year would have been a half decade that Bokaba worked with us, Mahamba said. He was a nice colleague who was hard working and dedicated to his job. He was also a humble person who never lost his temper. A hero has definitely been lost. The department is saddened by his loss and would like to extend condolences to his family and friends; more especially, to the friend who was with him when he was shot, said Mahamba.He urged anyone with information to contact the police. We are concerned about the killing of one of our own. We will co-operate with the SAPS to find those responsible, he said.Persons with information regarding the incident are advised to contact the nearest police station or the TMPD at 0123587095/6.Pretoria News
