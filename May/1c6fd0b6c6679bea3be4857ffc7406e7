"The Labour Court today at 14:00 [on Wednesday] dismissed the interdict. The Chairperson of the disciplinary hearing had granted the postponement until today and the hearing will therefore recommence at 18:00 this evening," SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said in a statement. Motsoeneng is facing the disciplinary hearing for calling a media briefing on April 19 in which he attacked the new interim board for scrapping his 90/10 local music policy. The defiant Motsoeneng is facing concurrent disciplinary hearings stemming from a Public Protector report that found that he had lied about his qualifications, purged staff and increased his salary exorbitantly during his tenure at Auckland Park, the SABC headquarters in Johannesburg. A ruling by the Western Cape High Court in December last year found that Motsoeneng was unfit to hold any office until such time a fresh disciplinary hearing cleared him of any wrongdoing, or if a court set aside the Public Protector's report.
