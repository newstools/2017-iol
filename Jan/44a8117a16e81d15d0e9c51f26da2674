Because I ll tell you what: no computer is safe. I don t care what they say.&quot;Mr Trump rarely uses email or computers but frequently sends out Twitter messages to his 45 million-plus followers.Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do.
