'La La Land' leads this year's British Academy Film (Bafta) Awards nominations with 11. The blockbuster musical – which scooped a record-breaking seven Golden Globe at the weekend – is up for the coveted Best Film prizes, while filmmaker Damien Chazelle and stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are in the running for director and acting accolades. The movie will contest against 'I, Daniel Blake' – which scooped the prestigious Palme d'Or at last year's Cannes Film Festival – 'Arrival', 'Moonlight' and 'Manchester by the Sea' for the Best Film accolade. Hot on the heels of 'La La Land' in the nominations stakes are 'Arrival' and 'Nocturnal Animals', which each have nine, followed by 'Manchester By the Sea' with six. In the Leading Actor category, Ryan faces competition from Andrew Garfield ('Hacksaw Ridge'), Casey Affleck ('Manchester by the Sea'), 'Nocturnal Animals' star Jake Gyllenhaal and 'Captain Fantastic's Viggo Mortensen, while Amy Adams – who is nominated for her performance in 'Arrival', but not 'Nocturnal Animals', Emily Blunt ('The Girl on the Train'), 'Florence Foster Jenkins' star Meryl Streep and Natalie Portman ('Jackie') will face off against Emma for the Leading Actress accolade. Meanwhile, 'I, Daniel Blake' and 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' can count the Outstanding British Film accolade among their five nominations, while 'American Honey', 'Denial', 'Notes on Blindness' and 'Under the Shadow' are also up for the prize. The nominations for this year's event were announced on Tuesday January 10 by Dominic Cooper and Sophie Turner. Winners are chosen by Bafta's 6,500 members, except for the EE Rising Star Award – whose nominees were unveiled last week – which is voted for by the public. The 2017 Bafta awards will take place at the Royal Albert Hall in London on February 12 and will be hosted by Stephen Fry.
