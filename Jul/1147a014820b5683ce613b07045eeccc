Johannesburg - Hell hath no fury like a controversial pastor who went to hell and killed the devil, horns and all. Pastor Paseka Motsoeneng, also known as Pastor Mboro, claimed on Facebook he went to hell and rid the world of its evils by killing the main man himself, Lucifer. But after receiving negative feedback on his Facebook post, Mboro deleted it. Mboro wrote: “When I got to hell, there was a queue of millions of people waiting to be braaied by Satan. I even saw some prominent South African politicians. “I was so shocked because they lived like angels here on earth. I thought they went to heaven. “When Satan saw me, he panicked and directed his army to kill me. Like Samson in the Bible, I defeated them. Satan was my last victim.” This is not the first heavenly claim the preacher has made. According to Mboro, he was so overcome by the spirit last year on Easter Sunday; he went to heaven and took pictures on his Samsung Galaxy Smartphone. The pastor then sold the heavenly pictures for R5 000 each. He also claimed to have access to the Pearly Gates and could get people in - at a heavenly price, of course. Mboro was charging members of his congregation R10 000 for guaranteed access. He also claimed he is so blessed that God sent him a BMW i8 valued at R2 million for helping the poor with his good deeds. “The Bible says those who take care of the poor will be lifted up by Jesus. I’ve been helping the poor. God is rewarding me, with an i8,” Mboro said. Daily Voice
