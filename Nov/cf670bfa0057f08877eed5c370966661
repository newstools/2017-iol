Socialite and singer Nonhlanhla Qwabe, better known as Skolopad, set tongues wagging last night at the 2017 Feather Awards pink carpet when she rocked up covered in pieces of boerewors. Wait for it...she also carried a charcoal bag as an accessory on one hand and on the other hand her date, a young man in a brown suit.  Asked about her outfit, Skolopad said she was inspired by the "pig meat.” “People have been saying beef. I don’t have beef, I like wors and after this (ceremony) siyabraya (we are going to braai wors)” she said.  Earlier this year Skolopad became an instant social media sensation after she rocked the yellow dress revealing a tattoo on her bum on the Metro FM Awards black carpet. Skolopad.
