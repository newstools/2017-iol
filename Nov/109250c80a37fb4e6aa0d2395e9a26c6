Mark Wahlberg asked for God's forgiveness for making 'Boogie Nights' because he realises that the all-powerful Supreme Being may not be OK with movies about porn stars. The 46-year-old hunk recently admitted there are a number of movies that he regrets making and right at "the top of the list" is the award-winning 1997 drama in which he played X-rated actor Dirk Diggler, a character based on real-life adult movie maker John Holmes. Wahlberg is a devout Roman Catholic and he told the Chicago Tribune: "I just always hope that God is a movie fan and also forgiving, because I've made some poor choices in my past." While promoting his new film 'Daddy's Home 2', Wahlberg admitted he feels that way about some of his previous roles because he's older and wiser and realises that some of his work doesn't necessarily sit well with his morals and religious beliefs. He told PEOPLE: "I was sitting in front of a couple of thousand kids talking about and trying to encourage them to come back to their faith, and I was just saying that I just hope he has a sense of humour because I made some decisions that may not be OK with him. So, I don't want to compromise my artistic integrity or choices based on my faith or my family, but I also have other things to consider, and being a little bit older and a little wiser, the idea of having to explain that movie and the reason behind it to my kids is another issue." Wahlberg had a meeting with Pope Francis - the head of the Catholic Church - in 2015 and during their get together the 'Transformers: The Last Knight' star jokingly asked His Holiness' forgiveness for making foul-mouthed comedy 'Ted' - in which his character John Bennett is seen smoking cannabis and heavily drinking with his living teddy bear best friend. The actor also revealed he prays every morning and finds the time by being an early riser by going to bed at before eight o'clock every evening. The Hollywood star - who is married to model Rhea Durham and has four children with her - also regularly goes to confession to admit his wrongdoings to his priest and he says it's part of his continual quest to improve himself.
