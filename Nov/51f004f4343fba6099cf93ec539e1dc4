Johannesburg - One just has to look at the quantity of ‘Raptorfied’ Rangers and similarly decorated Hiluxes on SA’s roads to realise that there is a demand for mean-looking, accessorised bakkies. Mitsubishi has become the latest manufacturer to cash in on that craze with a limited edition Triton called the Xtreme. Just 50 are up for sale and Mitsubishi SA says it has added R60 000 worth of exterior accessories for a price premium of just R20 000 over regular double cab Tritions. The body kit is imported and fitted by Mitsubishi SA, and includes some of the most expensive accessories that its customers tend to opt for. The kit includes black and chrome alloy wheels with Cooper Adventurer All-terrain tyres, wheel arch covers, a stylebar, tonneau cover, bonnet and light guards, heavy-duty rubber mats and covers for the tailgate, fuel flap, door handles, grille and covers. The Xtreme Limited Edition is available in 4x2 and 4x4 guises, and the latter is also offered with the option of automatic transmission. Also as per regular Tritons, power comes from the familiar 133kW/420Nm 2.4-litre Mivec turbodiesel engine. In standard guise the Triton double cabs sell for between R479 995 and R559 995, which would theoretically put the cost of the Xtreme edition at between R500 000 and R580 000. IOL Motoring
