Somewhere in Russia - We don’t know exactly how this fight started, but the end result was two Mercedes SUVs, a first-generation ML and a fairly recent-looking G63 AMG, repeatedly bashing into each other while weaving through a convoy of rather expensive-looking cars, including a Rolls Royce. The video was posted on Facebook by Hart voor Auto's and the road rage brawl was said to have taken place in Russia. Regardless, that kind of behaviour is reckless and just downright ridiculous; and certainly proof, if you ever even needed it, that money doesn’t buy class.   IOL Motoring
