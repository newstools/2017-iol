Hashim Amla and Temba Bavuma were the top scorers for the Proteas on the second day of their three-day tour match against the England Lions at New Road in Worcester on Friday. South Africa finished on 382/4 in 97.3 overs when bad light ended play early, after most of day one was washed out. The Proteas resumed on 58/1, with Amla and newcomer Heino Kuhn at the crease. The right-handed pair proceeded to punish the Lions bowlers, with Kuhn registering 80 off 126 balls (16x4) before retiring out, while Amla compiled 91 off 148 deliveries (12x4, 1x6) and also retired out. Particularly pleasing for Proteas coach Russell Domingo would’ve been the form of Bavuma, who was on an unbeaten 85 at the close, while Quinton de Kock was the fourth batsman to score a half-century (51). Left-hander JP Duminy, though, was unable to convert his start into something substantial, falling for 25 while batting at No 4. Theunis de Bruyn, who is likely to deputise in the middle-order in next week’s first Test against England at Lord’s if captain Faf du Plessis is still unavailable, was trapped lbw for a duck by Liam Plunkett.
