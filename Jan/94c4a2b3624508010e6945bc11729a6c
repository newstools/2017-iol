Johannesburg - Low-cost carrier FlySafair says it made a profit in 2016, the carrier s second year of operations.This, it notes in a statement issued on Tuesday, comes despite a tough trading environment, with low economic growth and an over-supply of seats on domestic routes.During 2016, it added three new aircraft to its operating fleet, bringing it to a total of 9 aircraft. In August, the airline also launched new routes from Lanseria to Cape Town and George. There s no doubt that the market is heavily traded at the moment with an excess supply of seats on domestic routes, says FlySafair CEO Elmar Conradie. Fares are determined by a market and are very much at the mercy of the powers of supply and demand. If supply grows more than demand, prices will fall.

Now, more than ever, it s essential that carriers focus on keeping their cost per seat as low as possible, says Conradie. It s essential that we drive efficiencies across all aspects of our business to remain competitive. By the end of 2016, the company had flown more than 2.6 million passengers and maintained an on-time performance record of 95.8 percent.For 2017, FlySafair is looking at a year of consolidation. We re looking at a few possible expansion plans, but the aim for this year is to slow the growth a little and work on making small differences that will improve our cost efficiencies in order to keep fares as low as possible.
