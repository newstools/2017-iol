Keagan Dolly has been brought into the Bafana Bafana starting line-up for their dead-rubber 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifier against Senegal in Dakar on Tuesday night (9.30pm kickoff SA time). Bafana Bafana are already out of the race to qualify for Russia 2018, although there is a back door still open with regards to their appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) surrounding their 2-1 win over the Lions of Teranga that was declared null and void. The French-based Dolly replaces Lebogang Manyama in midfield, while Bongani Zungu also earns a berth in the match XI. Zungu was suspended for last week’s 2-0 defeat at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, but comes in for Kamohelo Mokotjo. Coach Stuart Baxter, though, didn’t make wholesale changes, with the rest of the team intact despite losing last Friday. Bafana Bafana Starting XI Itumeleng Khune (captain), Thamsanqa Mkhize, Sifiso Hlanti, Clayton Daniels, Morgan Gould, Dean Furman, Bongani Zungu, Themba Zwane, Percy Tau, Keagan Dolly, Sibusiso Vilakazi. Substitutes: Wayne Sandilands, Mulomowandau Mathoho, Tebogo Langerman, Lebogang Manyama, Siphiwe Tshabalala, Kamohelo Mokotjo, Tiyani Mabunda, Dino Ndlovu, Andile Jali, Bradley Grobler, Phakamani Mahlambi, Motjeka Madisha.
