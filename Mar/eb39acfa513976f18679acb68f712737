DURBAN - In the end, the only winner at Kingsmead on Friday night was the weather – and perhaps the bunny chow vendors who warmed the cockles of Durban bellies and hearts on a wintry evening.  On the field, sadly, the Dolphins and the Warriors were left frustrated by the elements, and their Momentum One-Day Cup fixture was eventually abandoned after 36.4 trying overs.  The groundsmen at Kingsmead certainly earned their crust, as Mother Nature played a cruel version of 'Gotcha' with them, the covers going on and off like the water supply in upper Morningside.  Durban itself got a decent luck of rain, and the green-fingered brigade will be most grateful for whatever they got.  The Dolphins, still top of the log, would have fancied their chances, especially after Morné van Wyk and Vaughn van Jaarsveld added 139 for the first wicket, having chosen to bat first.  Van Wyk eventually chalked up 92 off 93 balls, while his new opening partner bulldozed 85 off 94 balls. Even after they departed, skipper Khaya Zondo fashioned a cheeky 47 not out off 29 balls.  A total of 236 for four after 36.4 overs, with serious hitters to come, would have left the home dressing-room cursing the weather gods.  For them, Friday night would have felt like two points lost, and they will now observe their rivals over the weekend, to see how much damage is done to their buffer at the top.  The food and beverage vendors, meanwhile, would have seen it as a blessing in disguise, as the officials held onto the hope of some play until just before 8pm, thus forcing those spectators who came, to nibble the time away.  Each to their own.  Independent Media
