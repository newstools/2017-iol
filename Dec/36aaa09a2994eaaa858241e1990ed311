The Mzansi music family mourned the passing of Robbie Malinga at a memorial service held at Grace Bible Church on Friday. The program director for the service was Kabelo “Bouga Luv” Mabalane. Following a short prayer, Mabalane called upon gospel singer, Lebo Sekgobela to lead those congregated at the church in worship. Malinga’s family recounted what a loving father and husband the musician was. They told stories about his acts of kindness and spoke of his humility. His in-laws described him as “the protector of the family.” His family spoke fondly about how his talent was evident from a young age - that he was destined to either be a politician or a musician. Luckily, the Music prevailed. Mourners gathered for Malinga's memorial service at the Grace Bible Church in Soweto.  Photo: Nokuthula Zwane Malinga’s sister kept the audience in stitches with stories of a humorous brother. Shadrack Ndlovu, who was an early frequent collaborator of Malinga, reminisced about how Malinga went from bubblegum to Kwaito. He spoke about a time they wanted to be let out of a lifetime contract with label, Cool Spot. Malinga’s resourcefulness created the appearance of an AK47 lodged in the back of his shirt. This forced the powers that be to immediately release them but even in that scenario, Malinga had some wisecracks. Even the artists he produced had their own stories about what a funnyman Malinga was. Malinga’s memorial was a celebration fit for a man who touched many lives.   Robbie Malinga’s funeral will take place at Rhema Bible Church on January 2 at 8am
