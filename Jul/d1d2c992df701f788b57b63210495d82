Roger Federer admitted he was nursing a bad hangover on Monday after celebrating a record eighth Wimbledon singles title. The Swiss star breezed past seventh seed Marin Cilic 6-3 6-1 6-4 in Sunday's final to move clear of Pete Sampras and William Renshaw as the only man to have won Wimbledon eight times. Victory was also the 35-year-old's 19th grand slam title, which takes him four clear of Rafael Nadal, and he toasted his second major of 2017 at the traditional champions' dinner with women's champion Garbine Muguruza - followed by a trip to a bar with friends and family. "My head is ringing," Federer said on Monday morning. "I don't know what I did last night. I drank too many different types of drinks I guess. But after the ball we went to a bar and there was about 30 or 40 friends there. "We had a great time. I got to bed at 5 and I woke up and I didn't feel good. The last hour I have finally felt somewhat OK again. But we had a good time." Federer's haul of 19 major titles lifts him to joint-fourth on the all-time list of grand slam winners - alongside Helen Wills Moody - with only Margaret Court (24), Serena Williams (23) and Steffi Graf (22) ahead of him.
