Washington â€“ The US Department of Homeland Security laid the groundwork Tuesday for mass deportations of immigrants living illegally in the United States under an executive order by President Donald Trump last month. Trump had pledged to crack down on illegal immigration during his campaign and issued a series of executive actions on the matter last month, including a call to bolster resources for border security agents and increase detention space for illegal immigrants. The memos released Tuesday outline how officials will implement Trump's order. Two department memos offering guidelines on deportation stress that "with extremely limited exceptions, DHS will not exempt classes or categories of removal aliens from potential enforcement." "All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to enforcement proceedings, up to and including removal from the United States," the department said. The government will move to hire 10 000 new immigration officers and 5 000 border patrol agents, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said. The move marks a shift from immigration policy under president Barack Obama, who had increased efforts to deport illegal immigrants but focused on those who had committed a crime. The department said it would continue to prioritise removal of those convicted of criminal offenses, but expanded its priorities to also include those who "committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offence" and those who have committed fraud or abused public assistance. An estimated 11 million immigrants, primarily from Mexico and other Latin American countries, are residing illegally in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. dpa
