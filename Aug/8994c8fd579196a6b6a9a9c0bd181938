Wolfburg - Volkswagen has released some additional teaser sketches of its upcoming T-Roc compact crossover ahead of its official reveal on August 23. Inspired by the T-Roc concept of 2014, although evidently toned down somewhat, the new VeeDub is expected to compete at the sportier end of the compact crossover game, taking on the likes of Toyota’s C-HR and Nissan’s Qashqai. Shorter and lower than the Tiguan, but also built on VW’s MQB modular platform, the T-Roc is said to be quite closely based on the Audi Q2.   The vehicle will reportedly be offered with a wide range of engines, incuding 1.0 TSI, 1.5 TSI and 2.0 TSI turbopetrol units, as well as 1.6 TDI and 2.0 TDI turbodiesels. Most versions will be front-wheel driven, but VW’s 4Motion all-wheel drive will be offered as an option, as will its seven-speed DSG gearbox. Expect the T-Roc to mimic the recently-unveiled new Polo in offering a highly digitised cabin, complete with VW’s latest Active Info Display instrument cluster, and a long list of available gizmos, including active cruise control with Stop & Go traffic assist. Watch this space for the official details in two weeks from now. IOL Motoring
