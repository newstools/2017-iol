In celebration of the Solar Eclipse that took place this week, global sports brand PUMA dropped the Solar Eclipse Pack which featured eclipse inspired sneakers and tees. On 21 August a full eclipse could be viewed across the United States, an extremely rare natural phenomenon and some countries outside the US were lucky enough to view the full eclipse, with the rest of the world only seeing a partial eclipse. The PUMA Solar Eclipse Pack features three key footwear silhouettes with eclipse inspired details including subtle reflective details, solar-inspired prints and themed insoles. Available now at PUMA stores. READ:AKA signs a deal with Reebok Classics Blaze Cage Solar FM - R2 499
