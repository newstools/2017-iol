The pair went their separate ways to watch the performance and Tyga, 27, seemed displeased when Travis joined Kendrick on stage to perform 'Goosebumps'. The source said: "Once Kendrick went on stage, Tyga and his crew were escorted to the front of the stage to watch the performance. "[Halfway through Travis' song] a bodyguard began pushing through the crowd with a flashlight to get Tyga and his friends away from the stage. "After Travis exited the stage, Tyga emerged on the side nearest the fence to begin watching again, as Schoolboy Q took the stage to perform 'That Part' with Kendrick."
