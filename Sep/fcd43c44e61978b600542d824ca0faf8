London - Some might see it as a rather depressing sign of the times. Men in Britain would prefer to check their social media pages than make love in the morning, a survey has found. Scrolling through Facebook or Twitter was the most popular morning ritual for men, with 23 percent enjoying this activity most. But women did want to show some attention to their other half – as many said waking up with a hug and a kiss was how they wanted to start their day. Overall, one in three said the best way to wake up was to sunshine pouring through the windows, along with waking up to birdsong, the poll found. Taking time to enjoy a favourite breakfast option was also popular – with a full English top on the menu, followed by jam on toast. But one in ten admitted they preferred turning off the alarm clock and going back to sleep. The feel-good power of music was also high up on the list of popular morning activities, with many saying that hearing their favourite song got them fired up to face the day. Being active first thing was also found to be good for the soul, including walking the dog or taking the kids to school, as well as going to the gym. The survey was carried out by preserve and peanut butter makers Duerr’s. Richard Duerr, of the family business, said: "Feel good moments come in all shapes and sizes, but what unites them all is taking the time to enjoy the morning routine instead of rushing around. Start the day as you mean to go on." Daily Mail
