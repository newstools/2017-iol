Sugar makes for a sweet treat that few find easy to resist. But too much of the white stuff can rot our teeth, lead to weight gain and cause serious health problems such as diabetes. Health experts have advised that the majority of us need to drastically curb our sugar intake for our health but this can be hard to.

Instead buy some plain yoghurt and add fresh berries and nuts to the top.   Adjust recipes A lot of recipes call for sugar, but most will work without it, or without as much. Try halving the amount of sugar called for in the recipe next time you cook and see if anyone notices the difference.  Quit fruit juice Fruit juice contains all the sugar of fruit, but none of the nutritious fibre. Instead of juicing, eat fruit whole for your kick of fructose and drink water with a squeeze of fresh orange juice if you are bored of plain water.

Instead, alternate your tipple with a glass of water to reduce the sugar intake and keep yourself hydrated.  Switch your spread You may not think twice about what you put on your toast, but there's a lot of secret sugar in jam, syrup and especially chocolate spread. Instead, try peanut butter and sliced banana on toast as a healthy, sugar-free alternative.

Never go shopping when you're hungry as you're more likely to pick up sugary treats. Instead, visit the supermarket on a full stomach.
