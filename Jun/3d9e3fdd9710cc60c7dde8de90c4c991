Wearing heels might be a pain at times but it needn't be if you follow some of the precautionary measures that can help lessen the aches when stepping out in your pair. If the shoe fits: When was the last time you had your foot measured? You would be surprised how your foot size can change over the years, especially if you’ve had children. It might seem insignificant but even a half a measurement out can make a big difference between comfort and pain. The thicker the better: Very high- and thin-heeled stilettos should be reserved for special occasions not for your day-to-day walkabouts. If you wear high heels every day opt for ones with a thicker heel. Block heels remain fashionable. They add the height you’re looking for and are far more comfortable. Skating on thin ice: If the burn on the ball of your foot is what deters you from wearing heels then you should be wearing shoes with a thicker sole. Shoes with a bit of a platform offer more relief as well. Get padded: Gel foot pads are the best thing that could have been invented for a lover of heels. Silicone pads help prevent the foot from sliding forward which helps to protect your toes as well as reducing the pains experienced under the ball of your foot. Take time out: While sitting at your desk or having a moment off your feet, take a few minutes to stretch your toes and rotate your ankles. Stretch your toes by pointing them down and them pulling them back up. Move your foot in circular motions to bring some relief to your ankles.
