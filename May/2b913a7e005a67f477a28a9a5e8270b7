He loves going on social media to show off his luxury apartment, cars (2 Bentleys) and expensive watches (Rolex), but Cassper Nyovest has always maintained that he’s “humble”. Humility, however, is a matter of opinion. And just few hours ago, the Mama I Made It star was forced to defend himself as the haters gathered to denounce the way he flaunts his most prized possessions. “It’s two Bentleys, a new V Class and new sprinter, five Rolexes and I’m rich as f**k,” he humbly tweeted. Cassper was responding to a naysayer’s tweet that read "I have Bentleys, Rolex and I'm Rich, Like we don't know that." It seems Cassper has had enough of 'haters' as he kept hitting back:  The rapper shared his latest album's tracklist on social media and not everyone was impressed.  @JustKholii_ R120 for generic recycled beats, rapping, singing about nonsensical things.
