South Africa’s new multi-million dollar IPL superstar Kagiso Rabada will miss Wednesday’s second ODI against New Zealand due to “a niggle in his knee”. Proteas captain AB de Villiers revealed Rabada’s injury after winning the toss and asking New Zealand to bat in South Africa’s inaugural ODI at Christchurch’s Hagley Oval. The visitors made three changes altogether to the team that opened the series with a four-wicket victory in Hamilton last Sunday. While Rabada’s injury is no doubt of major concern, there was good news for Proteas fans, though, with David Miller having recovered from his finger injury. He is back in the line-up for the day game in Christchurch and will be joined by Wayne Parnell and Dwaine Pretorius, with Farhaan Behardien and Tabraiz Shamsi both sitting out. South Africa are also seeking a national record 13th consecutive ODI victory, which will place them second on the all-time list behind Australia’s 21 wins. New Zealand have kept the same line-up that were defeated at Seddon Park. Play starts at midnight SA time. Teams For Christchurch New Zealand: Tom Latham (wk), Dean Brownlie, Kane Williamson (captain), Ross Taylor, Neil Broom, Jimmy Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Colin de Grandhomme, Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Trent Boult. South Africa: Quinton de Kock (wk), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers (captain), JP Duminy, David Miller, Dwaine Pretorius, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Andile Phehlukwayo, Imran Tahir.  zaahier.adams@inl.co.za  Independent Media
