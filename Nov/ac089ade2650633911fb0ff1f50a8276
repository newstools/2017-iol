Outspoken rapper AKA said he is still keen to perform at Cassper Nyovest's #FillUpFNBStadium concert, despite their long-standing rivalry. A feud that was reignited last week when AKA took to Twitter to say they he would perform at the concert to make some "racks" (money) off an event that Cassper has described as being "the biggest performance of his career". Cassper's apparent response was a simple tweet. The rapper wrote: "Just buy a ticket to #FillUpFnbStadium broer..." Despite Cassper's cheeky response that soon trended as #JustBuyATicketBroer, AKA told TshisaLive that he would still perform at the concert if Cassper asked him, and the price was right. But AKA probably shouldn't hold his breath for a response from Cassper, as the muso has the support of fellow SA celebs, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula and a host of media appearances lined up to promote his 2 December concert.
