They also recovered goods such as bicycles, laptops and cellphones that were allegedly taken during the torching of the school. "On 11 September 2017 at 11.45am, pupils from Sokheni High School in Kranskop near Greytown allegedly torched the school setting classrooms alight and vandalising principal’s office. They were not happy about the condition of the school. During the incident, It is alleged that the pupils took property from the school and fled the scene," Zwane said. He said that a case of arson and theft was opened at Kranskop police station for further investigation. Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major-General Bheki Langa welcomed the arrests. “I strongly warn the learners not to vandalise the property that help them while at school. Damaging the property will not solve the problems and it will take years to fix the damages caused by them at school. Learners need to solve their differences with the school management or with the officials from Department of Education ,” he said. The nine are expected to appear in the Kranskop Magistrate’s Court soon. African News Agency
