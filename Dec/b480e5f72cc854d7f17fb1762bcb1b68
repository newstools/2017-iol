Havana - Communist-run Cuba's parliament
extended its legislative period by two months to April on
Thursday, delaying the historic transition from Raul Castro to a
new president, state-run media reported. The national assembly, which meets twice a year, put the
delay down to havoc wrought in September by Hurricane Irma,
which tore across the island lifting roofs, uprooting trees and
flooding low-lying coastal areas. Some Cuba watchers believe it is more due to concerns about
ensuring stability in the handover from the leaders of the 1959
revolution that ousted a U.S.-backed dictator to a new
generation. Castro and his late, older brother Fidel have led the
country for nearly 60 years. Their heir apparent, First Vice
President Miguel Diaz-Canel, was born the year after the
revolution and has a much weaker public profile. Cuba had already delayed municipal elections originally
planned for October by a month due to Hurricane Irma which
Economy Minister Ricardo Cabrisas said on Friday had caused
damage worth the equivalent of $13.2 billion. Traditionally Cuba evaluates damages from natural disasters
in dollars on the assumption that a peso is equal to the dollar.
Many other official exchange rates exist in Cuba valuing the
peso at much less. The political transition comes as Cuba faces a host of other
challenges from declining aid from its socialist ally Venezuela
to U.S. President Donald Trump's partial reversal of the
US-Cuban detente and tightening of the decades-old U.S.
embargo. Growth in tourism, transport and communications, agriculture
and construction nonetheless drove a 1.6 percent expansion this
year, Cabrisas told parliament. The number of tourists visiting the Caribbean's largest
island grew 19.7 percent on the year to 4.3 million in the first
11 months of the year, Tourism Minister Manuel Marrero told
parliament this week. Cabrisas said the government forecast the economy to grow
around 2 percent next year.Â   Reuters
