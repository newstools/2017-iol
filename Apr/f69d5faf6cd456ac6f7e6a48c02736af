The 35-year-old actress is currently "drawn" to "big, baggy" garments that resemble "chimney-sweeper trousers", but the blonde-haired beauty has admitted she has no idea where her interest in the androgynous style has stemmed from. Speaking to WWD about her fashion favourites, Sienna who has four-year-old daughter Marlowe with her former partner Tom Sturridge said: "I don't really know where it came from, but I'm quite into quite masculine workman's clothes. I keep getting drawn to big, baggy, sort of chimney-sweeper trousers and tweeds. High-waisted, bunched-up things and slightly odd shoes."

Speaking about her style evolution, the New York-born star who has starred in campaigns for designer brand Burberry said: "I used to be quite flirty and sexy, and now it's just like, 'Do-not-fancy-me' clothes." But Sienna prefers to look "unattractive" and have as little flesh on show as possible. She added: "The more unattractive I can make myself, the less flesh I can possibly show, the better."

The 'The Lost City of Z' star who portrays Nina Fawcett in the drama film said: "I can hate it [a product] and see it's got that Chloé label and be obsessed with it in a second."
