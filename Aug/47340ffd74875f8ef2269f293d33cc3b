Midrand - You’d be forgiven for thinking that Nissan had completely forgotten that it even builds the 370Z, so long has it soldiered on without any kind of revamp or refresh. Hard to believe, but Nissan’s latest Z car has been on the market for eight years now. Although a complete redesign would be welcome, Nissan is at least giving it a minor makeover for the 2018 model year, and the refreshed coupe is available to order in South Africa from 1 September. So what’s new? All versions now get the dark-tinted headlights and taillights that were previously only available on the Nismo model, and 2018 Zs can also told apart by new 19-inch alloy wheels, metal chrome door handles and a new black rear diffuser. Furthermore, Nissan has added a new Red Metallic exterior paint option. Nissan's premium infotainment system, featuring an 18cm touchscreen, satellite navigation, DVD player, and rear-view camera, is now standard. Mechanically the only alteration is the fitment of a new Exedy high performance clutch for six-speed manual versions, which is said to “perfect” the downshift motion. A seven-speed autobox remains available and the familiar 245kW/363kW 3.7-litre normally aspirated petrol V6 continues to power the rear wheels as before.
