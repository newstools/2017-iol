Cape Town - A man who allegedly murdered his girlfriend's father appeared in the Athlone Magistrate's Court on Tuesday on a charge of murder. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said the 27-year-old suspect allegedly shot and killed the man because he disapproved of the relationship with his daughter and had moved her out of the Western Cape. "The suspect shot the deceased while he was busy washing his vehicle last week Thursday in Samora Machel," Van Wyk said.  Police were tipped off about the suspect's whereabouts and arrested him on Sunday.  In a separate case, a 46-year-old man handed himself over to police on Sunday at about 11pm after he stabbed a man to death in Boys Town, Crossroads. He also appeared in the Athlone Magistrate's Court on a charge of murder on Tuesday. African News Agency/ANA
