Durban - Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe said unlocking
trade opportunities between countries on the African continent is key to
growth. Radebe arrived looking relaxed as vuvuzelas welcomed WEF
delegates to the ICC in Durban this morning. "If we want to negotiate economic integration, we
need to look at the continent as a whole. This includes infrastructure such as
roads, rail, air and ports. "We need to support intra-African trade to unlock
opportunities," he said. And with WEF highlights looking at inclusive economic
growth and the fourth industrial revolution, Radebe said skills development for
SA's youth is crucial. "To take advantage of the 4th industrial revolution
we need our youth to focus on science, technology, engineering and
mathematics," he said. The WEF conference has attracted business leaders from
across the globe to Durban this week and education and unemployment have been
identified as major challenges. Yesterday President Jacob Zuma said new and innovative
ways of thinking are needed to develop the region to avoid Africa being left
behind. The fourth industrial revolution has been identified as
building on the massive tech and digital revolution which requires constant
reskilling. INDEPENDENT MEDIA
