Washington - US President Donald
Trump's eldest son on Tuesday released an email chain which
refers to a top Russian government prosecutor as offering the
Trump campaign damaging information about Democratic rival
Hillary Clinton. "The Crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered to provide the
Trump campaign with some official documents and information that
would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would
be very useful to your father," said the June 3, 2016, email to
Donald Trump Jr. from publicist Rob Goldstone. "This is obviously very high level and sensitive information
but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr.
Trump," according to the email posted by Trump Jr. on Twitter.       Reuters
