Fashion and beauty blogger Aqeelah Harron-Ally from Fashion Breed will be hosting her second charity sale event Fashion Breed and Friends Charity Sale this Saturday, 2 December 2017 at The Palms, Woodstock from 10h00.
 
Harron-Ally will be selling over 200 fashion and beauty items, both new and gently used, and will be joined by a few of her favourite local brands, including Minimal Exposure, Lazuli and Know Scrubs. The entry fee of R25 per person and a percentage of all the sales will be donated to Muslim Hands NGO to facilitate the building of a water well to an African community in need. A sanitary towel drive for girls in need will also take place, and attendees are encouraged to bring them along.
 
The inaugural charity sale, which was held in March earlier this year, raised over R18,000 for Syria, as well as a collection of five bags of clothing for those affected by the Imizamo Yethu fire.
