Legendary South African musician Ray Phiri is set to be honoured with a memorial service in his hometown of Nelspruit today. Chikapa, as he was affectionately known, died last week at the age of 70 after a long battle with cancer. The memorial service has been organised by the premier of Mpumalanga's office and will be held at Mbombela Stadium. This will be the second memorial for the legend as another one was held yesterday in Newtown. Meanwhile, President Jacob Zuma has declared a special provincial funeral for the internationally acclaimed musician. Zuma, who lauded Phiri as a musical giant, said: "This is indeed a huge loss for South Africa and the music industry as a whole." Phiri was a founding member of the Cannibals, which was later joined by the late soul singer Mpharanyana. Years later he joined Stimela.Â In 2011, Zuma honoured Phiri with the Order of Ikhamanga in Silver for his contribution to the music industry.
