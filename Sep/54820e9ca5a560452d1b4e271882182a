 POOR punctuality can sometimes cost you your job. But it seems for some of us, a morning caffeine fix is more important than arriving at work on time. A study of 2,000 Britons found that more than one in four men and a fifth of women have arrived late because they haven’t finished their drink. In fact, the majority (54 per cent) of caffeine lovers say they couldn’t go to work without a coffee and one in ten claim they would be unproductive without one. Over a quarter claim that it’s an essential part of their morning routine and 16 percent claim their body doesn’t function properly without it. A third said they feel grumpy without one. The study – by Lyons Coffee – said the most likely age group to be late for work due to enjoying a coffee was 25 to 34 year olds (31 per cent). These were closely followed by 30 per cent of 35 to 44 year olds, 27 per cent of 18 to 23 year olds and 11 per cent of 45 to 54 year olds. Only 6 per cent of those aged 55-plus said they would dare to call in late. © Daily Mail
