On Saturday, the Space Odyssey is having a massive reunion at West End, situated in the old Cine 400 in Rylands Estate, with DJ Russel spinning on the decks and his much loved and respected sidekick Shaheed “Slang” Meisenheimer flicking the light switches. They plan to get patrons grooving to the sounds of old-school numbers, everything from Depeche Mode’s Reflexible to Brenda Fassie’s Weekend Special. Space Odyssey was the place to be in in Salt River in the late 1980s and was famous for its hot mixes. Neezaam Essop posted on Twitter: “Budgie would gate you with Purcells lol white levi...white t shirt...white troopers... black bomber jacket lol”, in reference to the club’s strict dress code at the time. “I was 16 years old when I started going to Space Odyssey even though the age restriction was 21,” said Essop. He fondly remembered that the music at the club was way ahead of the other clubs. Space Odyssey did not have a liquor licence in the late 1980s and revellers were allowed to bring their own “poison”, and Essop remembered VO Brandy and Coke as the drink of choice of the day. Anthea Tommy, who said she “would not miss the reunion for the world”, remembered halter-neck tops and Emme jeans. “You would buy your halter-neck top at the parade on Wednesday to wear to the club on Saturday night,” she said giggling. Her favourite was the opening Superman theme song that Russel the Love Muscle played religiously every week to open the dance floor. * Tickets for the reunion bash cost R100 and will be available at the door.
