Volkswagen’s Canadian website has given its viewers an early preview of the next-generation Jetta sedan ahead of its world debut at the Detroit Motor Show in January. As it goes with these things, there is no other official information on hand at the moment, but it is a given that the redesigned Corolla rival will be based on Volkswagen’s MQB modular platform just like the latest Golf and Passat, and that should also bring a weight saving. The new Jetta appears bigger than its predecessors, with an Audi-like profile, while the front end sees some Passat inspiration with pointy headlights flanking a large grille that stretches further down into the front bumper. As for engines, the new Jetta is likely to inherit VW’s new 1.5-litre TSI Evo engine as seen in the facelifted Golf, featuring cylinder deactivation and producing 110kW. At this stage it has yet to be confirmed when the newcomer will hit SA shores. IOL Motoring
