Munich, Germany - The name may sound like a “skunk works” performance kit, but in fact the BMW 6 Series M Sport Limited Edition is a trim option, available to order from April 2017 for all 6 Series models in  conjunction with the M Sport package. What you get is an exclusive metallic blue paint finish (new for 2017) special double-spoked, two-tone, 20 inch M alloys and carbon-fibre mirror housings. There’s more of the light stuff inside, including the trim finishers, gear selector lever, and door sill - the latter finished in blue with “M Sport Limited Edition” signage. You and your navigator sit on special comfort seats trimmed with fine merino leather in black and blue, your feet resting on special floor-mats with matching blue piping . A limited number of these ‘blue note’ Sixes will be built to order, based on any model in the 6 Series range - coupé, convertible or Gran Coupé - with your choice of a 230kW straight six turbodiesel, a 235kW turbopetrol six or a 330kW turbopetrol V8, each driving the rear wheels via an eight-speed Steptronic transmission. BMW South Africa has been allocated just four 650i M Sport Limited Edition Coupés, for delivery in the third quarter of 2017. Prices, as always, when they get here.
