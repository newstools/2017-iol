Italian motorcycling star Max Biaggi left hospital on Tuesday two weeks after being admitted following a huge accident during training. "I'm happy, I'm going home," said the 46-year-old Biaggi according to a web report by Gazzetta dello Sport. Biaggi underwent six operations in a Rome hospital after suffering severe chest injuries and broken ribs in a fall while training south of Rome on June 9. He had been riding alongside two riders from the team of which he is the manager when the accident occurred. The veteran racer is a two-time world champion in Superbike and a former four-time world champion in the 250cc class. AFP  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
