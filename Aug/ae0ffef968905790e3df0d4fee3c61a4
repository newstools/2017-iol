Being bitten by the travel bug can be both a blessing and a curse. Blessing because you get to see what the world has to offer, and curse because not everyone has the money to book holidays every month of the year. Thankfully, there are opportunities for free travel. Here are some ways to travel for free. Be warned, while you get to experience places for free, some work is involved.
