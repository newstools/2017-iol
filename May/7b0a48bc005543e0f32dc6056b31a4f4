Johannesburg â€“ The African National Congress said it can't say for sure if calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down will continue or come to an end after yet another failed attempt to remove him this past weekend. These were the words of ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe at a media briefing following the recent NEC meeting held over the weekend. The meeting saw yet another attempt to remove President Jacob Zuma fail. The move to remove Zuma from office was seemingly deferred on procedural grounds. It had not been on the agenda, and the NEC does note vote on issues but reaches consensus. Mantashe used the briefing to discuss some of the decisions taken by the NEC regarding issues such as Brian Molefe's reappointment to Eskom, the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry and the response to recent reports regarding damning emails showing how the controversial Gupta family "run South Africa". Speaking of Molefe's reappointment, Mantashe said the NEC stood by its earlier decision that it be rescinded. "Regarding the reappointment of Brian Molefe to Eskom, the NEC reaffirmed its stance that his appointment must be rescinded," he said. Mantashe also addressed issues around the succession debate, explaining that nominations were not yet open but would only open in September. This did not stop members from engaging and discussing potential candidates at their various structures. "We however caution against the defaming and ridiculing of candidates during this time," he said. On the issue of the motion of no confidence, Mantashe warned members of parliament to toe the party line during the motion. "ANC MPs taking part in the motion of no confidence are reminded to vote in line with the decisions taken by the party," he said. Other issues tackled included the call for a judicial commission of inquiry, which Mantashe confirmed the NEC supported and wanted to be accelerated.  khanyisile.ngcobo@inl.co.za  IOL
