Munich, Germany - Given the liberality with which BMW has been bestowing the John Cooper Works badge of late, it’s easy to forget that John Cooper and his father Charles started off in their Surbiton workshop, building racing cars and, later, preparing Minis specifically for the track - so this concept shows a welcome return to the nameplate’s roots. Starting with a race-tuned two-litre turbopetrol four and track-focused suspension, the Mini John Cooper Works GP Concept is all about performance, just the way the Coopers would have liked it. The concept, finished in a deep metallic grey, with flashes of red and orange will be the centrepiece of the Mini stand at the 2017 Frankfurt motor show, opening next week. It gives a nod to today’s aero-kitted racers with deep aprons front and rear, side skirts and a striking rear spoiler, with plenty of clear-lacquered carbon-fibre on display. Inside, you’ll find an aluminium roll cage and one-piece buckets with five-point harnesses, but no rear seat, a head-up display for revs and vital signs, but no fancy dashboard, and suspension settings adjustable ‘on the fly’ from the circular centre touchscreen. We have just two words for it. Yes please. IOL Motoring
