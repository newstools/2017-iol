Hamamatsu, Japan - Suzuki has released the first official picture of its third-generation Swift Sport ahead of its reveal at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September. While we do get a full front-three-quarter view of the sporty new hatch, we’ll have to wait until Frankfurt to find out all the juicy details, and more specifically, what’s under the bonnet. Although nothing is officially confirmed yet, it has been widely reported that a version of Suzuki’s new 1.4-litre ‘Boosterjet’ turbopetrol engine, which will certainly be tuned to best the current Swift Sport’s 100kW output. The move will also mark the end of a high-revving, normally-aspirated era for the hatch, something that might upset some purists. On the upside, the Sport should be lighter than before, given that regular Swift hatchbacks are up to 120kg lighter than the previous generation on account of Suzuki’s new ‘Heartect’ architecture, shared with the Baleno. The humbler Swift models are due to reach South African shores early next year, hopefully with the new Sport version in hot pursuit. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
