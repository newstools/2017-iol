Last month Richard Hammond cheated death when he crashed an 800kW Ricac Concept One electric supercar during a hillclimb event in Switzerland. The Top Gear and Grand Tour star managed to escape from the supercar just in the nick of time, before it burst into flames, and escaped with an injured knee that will see him hobbling around on crutches for the next few months. But best you hear it all from the man himself. Hammond and his wife opened up about the ordeal during an interview with the UK’s ITV recently, accompanied by his wife Mindy, who got to explain her own toils, which involved looking after the injured ‘nine-year-old’ Richard after his operation. And if you’ve ever wondered about the ‘science’ involved in driving off a hill, this video should prove rather insightful. IOL Motoring  Like us on
