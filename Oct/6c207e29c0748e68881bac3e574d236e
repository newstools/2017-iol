Lifetime is set to debut a movie based on the Oscar Pistorius and the murder of Reeva Steenkamp in November. Based on the true-life account of the Valentines Day shooting, it focuses on both the actual event and the heavily publicised trial that followed after the shooting. READ: SA films in line for Academy Awards Starring New York-based actor Andreas Damm as Pistorius, and Toni Garrn as Steenkamp, the trailer looks as bad as the title of the Lifetime movie. Riddled with strange South African accents and a few actors sporting American accents this film is set to leave South African audiences unimpressed. While there is still no set date for the South African release the Lifetime movie is set to debut on November 11. The bad quality of the trailer should come as no surprise as Lifetime has a track record of making critically panned true life-based films. The last film that received a huge backlash was the Aaliyah true life story which was miscast, factually inaccurate and featured none of the songs.
