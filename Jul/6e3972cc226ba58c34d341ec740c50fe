Durban - From rainbow inspired hats to black and gold body paint, fashionistas came to slay at the Vodacom Durban July. Held in Durban's Greyville Racecourse, the event is a must attend for fashion lovers, punters and celebrities. The favourite so far is the bodypainted couple wearing bracelets by Maxhosa by Laduma. The outfits are his concepts. Also, loving the head-gear, from tradition beaded hats to fascinators, the hues are bright eye popping colors. The energy is high and this is what this year's race goers had to say:Â Irlene Nolan from PMB said this year's fashion was excellent and people have pulled out all the stops to look stunning. "My look is a mix of classy and dangerous, coupled with a wild and elelgant side. We're looking to have fun," she said.

Nomvelo Hlela, 23, from PMB, said this was first time she is attending the Vodacom Durban July. "My money is on horse number 12. Tonight I'll partying up a storm at the Moses Mabhida Fact Durban Rocks party." Disappointed after the opening race was Dr Sava Naicker, but the seasoned racing veteran still has hopes for a win in the main race. He has been attending the July since the 1960s. "In previous years I've taken home over R20 000. Here's hoping that this year brings me more luck." IOL Lifestyle
