Parliament - The ad hoc committee into the SABC has rejected a proposal by the UDM to call former SABC Chief Operating Officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng to give evidence.  Different parties told the UDM on Thursday that a decision was taken last week not to call further witnesses.  They said Motsoeneng blew the opportunity to give evidence when he walked out of the committee meeting a few weeks ago with other former SABC board members and executives.  The ANC, DA, ACDP, IFP, NFP and EFF said Motsoeneng would be afforded an opportunity to respond to the allegations against him after a draft report has been finalised.  ANC MP Makhosi Khoza warned that any attempt to bring back Motsoeneng would turn him into a demagogue.  She said this was not about an individual, but the state of decay at the SABC.  DA deputy chief whip Mike Waters said they had a deadline to meet and would not be delayed by Motsoeneng.  He said they will not keep inviting people to the committee.  Chairman of the committee Vincent Smith said this was a fair process, and the consensus was that Motsoeneng should not be invited to the committee.  “What is coming out from MPs is that anybody affected will be afforded an opportunity to respond. From where I am sitting this seems to be a fair process,” said Smith.  Political Bureau
