GELSENKIRCHEN – Borussia Dortmund midfielder Mario Götze says it’s time for the struggling side to turn their “talk into points”. Dortmund suffered their fourth defeat of the season against 11th-placed Stuttgart on Friday, losing 2-1 to slip to fifth on the Bundesliga table after 12 games. Things don’t get any easier for Peter Bosz’s team this week, with Tottenham Hotspur visiting for a Champions League clash on Tuesday and second-placed Schalke arriving on Saturday. “We need to sit down together and then find solutions on the pitch. Then we need to turn our talk into points,” Götze told the official Bundesliga website. “We know we’ve got a tough schedule, but we’re just taking things game by game. We know that we need to beat Tottenham, and of course Schalke, too. But we also know that we’re not in the best of situations.” Spurs have been in sparkling form in Europe this season, beating defending Champions Real Madrid in their previous match. However, Mauricio Pochettino’s side lost more ground in the Premier League title race in Saturday’s 2-0 defeat to Arsenal and will be itching to bounce back in Germany. Götze, who rejoined Dortmund from Bayern Munich in 2016 after leaving the club three years earlier, said the team must eliminate the errors from their play. “If you go behind to a mistake as we did, then things become difficult. We need to cut those mistakes out as quickly as possible,” the Germany midfielder said. “It wasn’t good for us to have to change how we wanted to play almost immediately. Then, just before halftime we levelled, but conceded again straight after the break. That was a bit of a kick in the teeth.” IOL Sport   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
