If you are like me and enjoy the simple pleasures of life, then you should take a drive to see the iconic Christmas lights on Dr Pixley KaSeme Street, previously known as West Street. Mayor of eThekwini Municipality, Zandile Gumede, officially switched on the iconic Christmas lights on Tuesday night. To mark the occasion, the city planned an energetic parade from King Dinuzulu Park, to Dr Pixley KaSeme Street to City Hall. The festivities was filled with a kaleidoscope of colour, art and culture. Growing up in Durban, the Christmas lights at Dr Pixley KaSeme Street was a sight to behold. My family would drive to central Durban to join in the festivities and see the lights. I remember the huge traffic delays, with people travelling far and wide to see Durban lit up. It is one of those traditions that travellers to Durban should see before they leave the city. At the event, dancers, artists and locals paraded through the streets of Durban, chanting Jabula uphephe (enjoy and be safe), one of the slogans for the cityâ€™s festive season campaign this year. Guests and media were on the Durban rickshaw bus that offered 360 degree views of the warm city and its locals. Gumede showed some of her dance moves as the bus drove along the busy streets of Durban. Passengers captured the moment with live Facebook videos and Instagram stories.
