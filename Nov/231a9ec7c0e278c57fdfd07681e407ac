Cape Town City’s head coach McCarthy, said: “I think it’s time for men to step up and not to make excuses anymore for beating our women and children. “We have to be the protectors and not the abusers. For a better life for all. “As a father myself, I think more men should begin to step up in protecting our women and children. It will definitely help and make you a better man.” Duminy who plays for the Cape Cobras, said what was happening to women and children was devastating. “I encourage all men to stand up against this abuse. We should no longer tolerate this abuse and violence against women and children. My wife, Sue, works at a house for abused children, so we know the effects of it.” O’Connor said campaigns to stop violence against women and children should happen every day. “More people need to stand up against it because it has a huge impact on people. Especially this time of year, you hear about how many people were affected by violence and abuse  It has also become important  for men to stand up against it,” he said. McKay said as a father himself, campaigns against woman and child abuse was important. “Boys need to be taught they should not lift their hands to girls. They need to be told from a young age to respect the opposite sex. Parents need to lead by example. “I would also say, we should have this sort awareness 365 days of the year. Because there is so much abuse in households. When parents see the first signs of abuse, they must do something about it immediately. They must teach their children the abuse of women and children is unacceptable in society,” McKay said.
