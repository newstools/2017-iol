Durban - The Democratic Alliance has called for an immediate forensic investigation into all security contract tenders in the eThekwini metro municipality. This follows media reports of political interference in the issuing of security tenders. Reports allege that in the past 10 years those connected to the governing African National Congress have been favoured against other security companies for tenders over R50 million, the DA said on Sunday. "The DA wants the investigation to look into the allegations of unlawful extension of contracts resulting in invoking of section 36 [regulations of the cityâ€™s supply chain management policy]," DA KwaZulu-Natal leader Zwakele Mncwango said. "All of this mismanagement and maladministration could have been prevented if the ANC leadership in eThekwini had taken our advice and incorporated security within the organs of the municipality. This would ensure job security among workers while saving the municipality hundreds of millions of rand. "The period of looting and benefitting cronies is in full swing in the ANC. Public funds meant to provide services to the poor are being squandered by the ANC cronies in every possible way," he said. If the people of eThekwini who spent their last cents paying for services in the municipality did not stand up, they would wake up one day with a municipality that could no longer function. "We are calling on the residents of eThekwini not to allow this plundering to continue. We hope the investigation reveals the names of those responsible for breaking the laws of this country so that they can face the full might of the law," Mncwango said. African News Agency
