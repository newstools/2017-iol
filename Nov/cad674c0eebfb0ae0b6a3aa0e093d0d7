LONDON – Eddie Jones has apologised for a foul-mouthed outburst during England’s 21-8 victory over Argentina at Twickenham last weekend. The England coach vented his frustration during the second half, with television cameras showing him slamming down a notebook in the coaches’ box in the second half and mouthing “F**k, how f***ing stupid are we?” “I’d like to apologise for swearing in public,” Jones told reporters at England’s training base in Bagshot, south-west of London, on Monday. “It’s not acceptable, so I apologise for that and I’ll find a different way to express my frustration in the future,” the Australian added. Victory saw England made it 20 wins in 21 Tests under Jones, the only blot on the former Australia and Japan coach’s Red Rose record a defeat by Ireland in Dublin in March that denied them a repeat Six Nations Grand Slam. As for a faltering display against the Pumas, Jones said he had to carry the can. “I thought our effort and application were first-class. Argentina are a difficult team, but I obviously didn’t coach the team well enough,” Jones said. Really struggling to work out what Eddie Jones says here. He seems pretty happy with the England efforts!! 😂 🎥Rugby Pass pic.twitter.com/BA9e8aj1Xi — EatSleepRugby (@eatsleeprugby) November 13, 2017   “It’s my fault the team didn’t play well, so I take full responsibility for that,” he insisted ahead of England’s match against his native Australia at Twickenham this coming Saturday. “I just didn’t coach them well enough.” AFP
