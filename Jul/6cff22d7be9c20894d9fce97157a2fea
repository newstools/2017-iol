CAPE TOWN - After a season of discontent, Orlando Pirates have taken a first step to getting back on track by signing Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands. The Buccaneers announced the arrival of Sandilands on a free transfer on Thursday on their Twitter feed, and it is hoped that the 33-year-old shot-stopper will bring some stability to the Pirates backline. Kjell Jonevret’s team ended last season without any silverware and finished a lowly 11th in the Premiership, their worst display for many years. Pirates also conceded 40 goals in the league last season, with only three other teams giving away more – Highlands Park and Golden Arrows (44), as well as Baroka FC (43). Sandilands, who has eight Bafana caps, had a bit-part role at Mamelodi Sundowns over the last few seasons, with Ugandan Denis Onyango establishing himself as one of the finest goalkeepers on the continent as the Brazilians claimed the Caf Champions League crown. Sandilands will face some competition for game time at Pirates as well, as there are four other goalkeepers in the squad at the moment – Brighton Mhlongo, Jackson Mabokgwane, Siyabonga Mpontshane and Emmanuel Daniel. But Jonevret is sure to let go one or two of those players following Sandilands’ appearance. Forward Thamsanqa Sangweni was the first major signing for Pirates in the off-season.    @ashfakmohamed IOL Sport   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
