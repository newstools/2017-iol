The 'This Is Us' hitmaker suffered a bad cut and a black eye after injuring herself on the shower door and had to call plastic surgeon David Stoker to her aid. Sharing the story on Instagram, she wrote: "Shower door handle- 1, Mandy- 0. Real talk: how does a girl get rid of a black eye pronto? Any helpful hints (minus Ice and arnica??). "Thanks @stokerplasticsurgery for coming in at 9pm to sew me up!! Never had stitches or a black eye before... what a day! (sic)" And Mandy's accident quickly became known on the set of 'This Is Us' and her fellow co-stars gave themselves black eyes using make up to show "solidarity" with the actress. Sharing a picture of her castmates with fake black eyes, she added: "Don't mean to blow up their spot but I have the best work family ever, ever, ever. Come on!! Love you @zoehaymakeup, @michaelpreitzhair and @miloanthonyventimiglia. (sic)" Shower door handle- 1, Mandy- 0. Real talk: how does a girl get rid of a black eye pronto?

She explained: "I'm definitely ready for motherhood sooner rather than later! I think that's going to be the next chapter ... "I would definitely get married again. My life has sort of taken unexpected twists and turns professionally and personally, but overall my journey is the reason I am here today and I feel fulfilled by everything that happened." And Mandy recently said her "maternal side" had been awoken and she now feels as though she could handle being a mother off-screen. She said: "I didn't know how to change a diaper. I had crew members showing me how to change a diaper. I'm terrible, but yes it has sort of activated that maternal side of me that I'm totally ready to have kids now ... I mean, we get to hold these newborn children, and I can't believe their parents were willing to hand over their babies to me. I'm like, 'Hi, I'm Mandy. I have absolutely no experience with small children,' and they're like, 'Here's my two-week-old baby.'"
