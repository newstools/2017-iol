Grobler scored in the 2016 final against Orlando Pirates as SuperSport won 3-2 and will be hoping his teammates can defeat Chippa United in their semifinal, to be played at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane on Saturday. He has been missing since last November with a recurring groin injury, which required surgery in February as it failed to heal. He is now back in training and hopeful of being ready for the June 24 Nedbank Cup decider if Matsatsantsa can book their place. "Bradley is back in just about full training and is hoping to take part in some games in next few weeks," the player's father Les, co-coach at PSL side Highlands Park, reveals. "It's been a long process and it is always difficult with recurring injuries as you don¹t want to rush back. He is feeling a bit more positive and can see the light at the end of the tunnel." Grobler, who won his place back in the Bafana Bafana squad before his injury has managed just nine starts this season, but is an integral member of the SuperSport attack.  It's been a long 6 months of recovery and rehab but finally back with the squad and ready to playagain. — Bradley Grobler (@Bradley_Grobler) May 17, 2017   African News Agency   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
