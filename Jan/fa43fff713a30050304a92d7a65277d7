Durban Claims by the Democratic Alliance that eThekwini Metro mayor Zandile Gumede had illegally appointed the metro s municipal manager were simply wrong, her spokesman said on Tuesday. Gumede s spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said that the DA had not only got the law wrong, but had even got the name of the municipal manager wrong. He was speaking after the DA provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango issued a statement saying that Philip Sithole had been illegally appointed as municipal manager by the mayor. Mncwango said that any appointment of a municipal mayor by law was required to be approved by a full session of the municipality s council. The DA got it wrong. He [Sithole] is acting deputy city manager. There is an acting city manager as well. That is Dumisile Nene. He said that she was appointed at a full session of council on December 21. The DA walked out. There was a council meeting and they decided to walk out with the EFF [Economic Freedom Fighters]. That s where they got it wrong. All these things happened in their absentia. He said that Nene then appointed Sithole as acting deputy municipal manager. Sithole has been the municipality s head of business support, tourism and markets. Nene was previously the deputy city manager for corporate human resources. The post of municipal manager became vacant after the contract of S bu Sithole was not renewed. African News Agency
