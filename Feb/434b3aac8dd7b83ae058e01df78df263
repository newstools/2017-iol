Kia South Africa has initiated a safety recall for 305 Sportage models built between August 9, 2007 and May 22, 2009. The recall involves a wiring harness connector for the ABS braking system and Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) computer box, which may corrode due to an improper seal. If moisture enters the system it’s possible that the connector’s pins can short, resulting in a failure in the Hydraulic Electronic Control Unit’s circuit board. Kia says that in some cases the ESC or ABS warning light may illuminate. “The safety of our vehicles, and its owners, is a priority for KIA,” says Kia South Africa’s David Sief. “Most of the reports about this problem have occurred in countries with heavy snowfall, where roads are regularly treated with salt to avoid ice forming on the road surface. It is the salt in the water content that could cause the corrosion. No such incidents have been reported in South Africa.” Even so, Kia SA is taking a proactive stance and offering the recall service at no charge to owners. If you feel your Sportage may be affected you can enter your vehicle’s VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) into a portal on the brand’s website at www.kia.co.za or alternatively you can call KIA Motors South Africa Call Centre on 010-596-2000.
