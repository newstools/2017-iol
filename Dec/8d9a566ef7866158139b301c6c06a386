Johannesburg - Former Robben Island prisoner and anti-apartheid activist Laloo Chiba has died, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation said on Friday. “We would like to inform you that Ahmed Kathrada Foundation board member and former Robben Island prisoner, Laloo Chiba, 87, has passed away just a short while ago,” the foundation said in a statement.  “Chiba had a mild heart attack a few days ago and was hospitalised. He was discharged this week and passed away at his home in Lenasia.” Chiba, a very close friend of the late Kathrada, was an Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) platoon commander and was jailed for 18 years on Robben Island for his anti-apartheid activism. “Chiba considered Kathrada his best friend and political mentor and was devastated after Kathrada passed away in March this year,” said the foundation.  "He was also deeply grieved at the recent passing of fellow Robben Island prisoner, Eddie Daniels, whom he had visited just a few weeks ago in the Western Cape." Details of his funeral have not yet been finalised. Chiba is survived by his wife Luxmi, three daughters and grandchildren.   African News Agency
