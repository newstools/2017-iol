Musician and TV presenter Stoan Seate joins POWER 98.7 as the host of the music show, Power Fix. The show airs every Sunday from midday to 3pm. Seate is no stranger to radio, having hosted a music show on Motsweding FM almost a decade ago. The Afro Cafe presenter made a name for himself as a member of the popular music group Bongo Muffin, which he formed in 1996 along with Thandiswa ‘KingTha’ Mazwai and Jah Seed. Following the group’s success and the release of five albums, Seate next established himself as an actor and television presenter. “I’m looking forward to joining the POWER movement and connecting with South Africans through music and the issues that affect us in our daily lives. I resonate with what the brand stands for and looking forward to getting behind the microphone once again” says Seate.   MSG Afrika’s Head of Programming, Bob Mabena, is equally enthusiastic about Stoan joining the POWER team. “Because we do talk so well and our listeners agree, we had to take our music and lifestyle daypart just as seriously. Who better to slot in there than a grounded African young man who has cemented his rightful place firmly in the hearts and minds of progressive South Africans. Stoan is a natural fit for POWER”. ** POWER Fix with Stoan Seate will broadcast live from the POWER 98.7 Mall of Africa studios every Sunday at 12h00 from June 4 . IOL
