Born from the brand’s innovation lab, Raw Research II embodies the latest efforts to push the boundaries of denim, bringing it to new heights. The lab experiments with product design by clashing tradition and innovation, bringing a new capsule collection. G- Star Raw introduces the brand’s latest denim innovations as prototypes, which function as the blueprints for the following main collection – the brand’s design DNA in its purest form. The highlight innovation of the Raw Research II collection is a brand new 3D denim concept: the Motac series. As the result of a rigorous study of the human body in motion, this series features styles that have been engineered as hybrids, translating biker-inspired principles of a moving body into constructed garments.

These pieces reflect the collection’s design philosophy and symbolize a pivotal step towards breaking new grounds in denim design.
