 London - Firefighters broke down in tears during a minute’s silence for the victims on Monday. Placing their helmets on the ground, some of the 200 heroes who fought the Grenfell Tower blaze joined survivors for the silence at 11am, which took place in the shadow of the ravaged building. Members of North Kensington’s Red Watch also laid floral tributes, with moving messages apologising for not being able to save more lives. One read: ‘I’m sorry we couldn’t get to you’.Another said: ‘We tried, we’re sorry, 20th floor.’ Survivors including the parents of missing Jessica Urbano, 12, hugged firefighters – many of whom, despite being ‘exhausted and traumatised’, have returned to work to help search the wreckage for bodies.
