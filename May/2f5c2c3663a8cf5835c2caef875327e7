Johannesburg - Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has faced yet another defeat in getting answers from the National Prosecuting Authority on whether it will take action against President Jacob Zuma over unlawful upgrades at his Nkandla homestead. This comes after the opposition party gave the prosecuting authority until the close of business on Monday to reply to its letter on whether it intends to prosecute President Jacob Zuma or not. In a bid to meet the DA’s deadline the NPA replied and said it needs to conduct further investigations before it can arrive at a decision. But in a statement, Maimane said the NPA’s delay tactics were unacceptable. “This matter is straightforward. An investigation has been concluded, and the docket has been sent to the NPA. The role of the NPA is simple – it must decide to either prosecute Jacob Zuma or not prosecute Jacob Zuma,” he said. Maimane previously said he was tired of being given the run-around by the NPA since he laid charges against Zuma three years ago in relation to the unlawful upgrades at his home that cost R246 million. The party will now approach Minister of Justice, Michael Masutha and petition him to urgently looked into the matter. Maimane said failing to this, the party will be left with no choice but to approach the courts to compel the NPA to make a final decision. Politics an Development Hub
