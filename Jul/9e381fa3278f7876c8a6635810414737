Prince Harry became a journalist for the day when he interviewed a Paralympics champion and former Army captain Dave Henson about the Para Athletics Championships. The flame-haired royal is usually in front of the camera being interviewed himself but there was a change of roles when he chatted to former Army captain Dave Henson, who lost both legs above the knee after stepping on a mine in Helmand Province in 2011, as he prepares to take part in the Para Athletics Championships. Henson was fitted with artificial legs and after hard work, perseverance and gruelling training, he won a bronze medal for Great Britain at the Rio Paralympics last year and has now turned his attention to the London championships, which starts on Friday. He said: "I was still very early on in my recovery and rehab stage, it was a little bit of inspiration because it was suddenly an exposure to people absolutely smashing sport. "I went to the Olympic Park a couple of times and it was just such an incredible atmosphere, everyone was so happy." Prince Harry urged the public to support the championships by getting themselves some tickets to the event. He said: "Buy your tickets, get down there, bring your family and friends and come down and support. Be there with everybody else, creating that atmosphere that's going to be a life-changing moment for Dave and everyone else." And Henson hopes he will finish the championship with a medal. He added: "I don't have a World Championship medal, so to take one of those home would be just incredible. I'd love to come away from it with a World Championship medal around my neck "Spectators will see the world's best Para athletes compete in one of the world's most iconic sports venues. Every single member of the GB team, every single athlete that has qualified is an incredible sportsperson." Bang Showbiz
