Johannesburg - Mine safety is likely to be among the topics that will dominate next week s Mining Indaba in Cape Town, according to Joburg-based analyst Sibonginkosi Nyanga. Nyanga, an equity research analyst at Momentum SP Reid Stockbrokers, said yesterday that although the mining charter was likely to come under discussion, mine safety was topical. Mine safety has always been an issue, even as far back as during the tenure of the previous minister, Susan Shabangu, he said.The Department of Mineral Resources and some companies have already locked horns over mine safety. Sibanye Platinum last week said it had served summonses on Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane and three officials from his department, claiming R26.8million. This is for losses incurred during a safety stoppage at Sibanye s Kroondal mine in the North West.Read also: SA mine deaths rise after years of improving safetyLast November, AngloGold Ashanti successfully challenged a section 54 stoppage at its Kopanang mine. The department can apply section 54 of the Mine Health and Safety Act to effect a safety stoppage at a mine. In response to Sibanye s move, Zwane last week said it was unfortunate that Sibanye and AngloGold Ashanti suggested, through their utterances in the media, that they were refusing to comply with South Africa s mining laws. Last week, AngloGold Ashanti said: We continue to seek dialogue with the (department) at every level, with the primary aim of improving safety. In his address at last year s Indaba, a few months after his appointment, Zwane raised the importance of mine safety. He said the department would continue to be hands-on in enforcing compliance with the Mine Health and Safety Act.CAPE ARGUSFor full coverage of the #MiningIndaba, read @busrep and pick up Business Report.
