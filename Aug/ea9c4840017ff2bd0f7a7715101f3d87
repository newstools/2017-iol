There is lots to celebrate at Mountain Zebra National Park.  The national park, situated  near Cradock in the Eastern Cape, celebrates their 80th anniversary this year and have successfully got the mountain zebra off the endangered species list. The Park Manager, Megan Taplin, said when the park was proclaimed in 1937 for the purpose of providing a nature reserve for the endangered Cape mountain zebra, there was only 11 left. However in 2017, the population has rose to 1100, the biggest population in South Africa. New accommodation facilities  The new accommodation facilities  will open in September. Taplin says the 8 new units include two rock chalets and 6 cottages. She said the reason for the construction of new facilities were the high occupancy rate of 85 percent. “We needed more facilities for our guests and we are so happy with the end result,”  said Taplin. The rock chalets are more upmarket than the other 3 star facilities with two bedrooms and en suites. The cottages are one bedroom, suitable for couples or two people sharing. Lots to see and do Not only would one see the Mountain Zebra, they would also see the lion, buffalo, cheetah and various antelope. The picturesque landscapes and wildlife make for great photographs, Taplin said.  Activities include cheetah tracking, game drives and walks. clinton.moodley@inl.co.za
