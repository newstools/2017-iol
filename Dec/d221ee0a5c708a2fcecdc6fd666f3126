According to an online portal, Livestrong, aside from its heart-health benefits, Zumba provides a workout for the whole body. From head and shoulder rolls that loosen up the neck and warm up the upper body, to footwork that strengthens and stretches calves and ankles, this fitness method works the full body. “Flexibility is not ignored in a Zumba class either, with warm-ups and cool-downs a regular part of Zumba programming.” Mood boosting Music is the main ingredient to Zumba classes which becomes an instant mood booster, according to Bomvana. “Music is a powerful tool. It helps you de-stress and gets you in a contagious happy mood. If anyone would go into a Zumba class at any given time, you are most likely to be greeted by smiles and laughter.” Toning Many who are stressed about toning after their weight loss won't have to change their exercise method once they shed a few kilos. Some Zumba classes put extra emphasis on toning and sculpting to define muscles. According to Zumba’s web portal, “lightweight maraca-like toning sticks used at Zumba classes enhance sense of rhythm and co-ordination, while toning targets zones, including arms, core and lower body.” It's social Bomvana says the high energy fitness, sweating to the Salsa and Reggaeton beats is good for sparking conversations and creating new relationships. “People come to most of our classes shy and reserved but, as soon as the music plays, a wave of energy and conversation fills the room instantly.”
