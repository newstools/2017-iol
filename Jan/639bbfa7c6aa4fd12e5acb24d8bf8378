Johannesburg It remains to be seen if the gloomy Joburg weather will hamper the ANC s efforts to fill up Orlando Stadium on Sunday for its #ANC105 birthday bash. It had been raining since Friday evening in the city of gold, and a heavy downpour continued throughout the day on Saturday. &quot;We anticipated adverse weather. We had said to our supporters and members that they need to come prepared. I don't think the event will be ruined. We can't predict what will happen at the main event tomorrow (on Sunday) but we are doing all we can to fulfil our goal of filling up the stadium,&quot; said national spokesman Zizi Kodwa.

Some social media users took advantage of the wet weather to remind the ANC that it would face challenges in packing the 40 000 capacity venue. Some coined the hashtag #Don'tFillUpOrlando to show their dissatisfaction with the event and the ruling party in its entirety. According to the South African Weather Service, there is a 30 percent chance of rain on Sunday. Up to 800 buses will transport the ANC's faithful to the venue. Some parts of the city and were flooded by mid-afternoon and ANC members were forced to finalise preparations in the rain. However, nothing could dampen the spirits of some supporters.
