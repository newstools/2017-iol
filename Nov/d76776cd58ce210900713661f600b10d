Car rental has been made easier over the years. Booking online or calling in to make a reservation is quick and efficient. With the ever-changing technological landscape, Budget Rent a Car has introduced a free app, making renting a car as easy as taking your cell phone out of your pocket, literally. The new app is compatible for both iPhone and Android, making it convenient for all. With the Budget app, you can book your car at any Budget location anywhere in the world. You also get the best value for money with up to the minute quotes for your vehicle of choice and location. Another feature on the app allows you to add extras like GPS, mobile Wi-Fi, child seats and more to your booking. The app allows you to make changes to your existing bookings and cancel any existing bookings. “The new Budget Rent a Car app will allow you to make car rental reservations on the move.  We are committed to making our customers’ booking experience as convenient and hassle-free as possible and this app is testament to this,” says Rainer Gottschick, Chief Executive for Budget southern Africa.
