 By: Motoring Staff Shandong Province, China â€“ A Kung fu master in China has set a new personal record by pulling seven Audi A6 sedans for eight metres using just his testicles... According to the Daily Mail, 39-year-old Ye Wei beat his previous record of five cars, performed last year, and while you might be imagining nothing but agonising pain and destruction, the stunt (called Xi Sui Gong) is actually said to improve fertility. And for that we'll take his word. Apparently with many years of training (and Wei has been practising Kung fu for three decades) one is able to strengthen parts of the anatomy to the point where feats like this are actually possible. Or at least not too hard. The task that is.  IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
