Egypt - Egypt's economy is expected to grow 4.0
percent in the 2016/17 fiscal year ending in June, broadly in
line with the finance minister's latest projection of 3.8 to 4
percent, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday. The poll predicts economic growth will slow the following
year to 3.3 percent, well below the government's target of 4.8
percent laid out in the budget, before accelerating to 4.0
percent in 2018/19, according to the median of 11 economists
polled by Reuters. The forecasts show annual growth is expected to remain
significantly below the roughly 7 percent recorded before the
2011 political uprising that led to the overthrow of president
Hosni Mubarak and scared off tourists and foreign investors. Read also:Â 'Egypt's growth is good news for SA' The government has announced a sleuth of reforms including a
currency float, fuel subsidy cuts and a value-added tax in an
effort to bolster the economic recovery and secure a $12 billion
loan from the International Monetary Fund. The pound currency has depreciated by roughly half since
currency controls were lifted in November, leading to a surge in
inflation and fall in imports. Egypt's core inflation rate declined for the first time in
eight months in March, slowing to 32.25 percent year on year
from 33.1 percent in February.   The median forecast for annual average core inflation which takes an average of the 12 monthly readings was 13.7
percent for the current fiscal year, up from a previous forecast
of 13.0 percent. Analysts expect inflation to jump in 2017/18 to 21.0 percent
before slowing to 13.0 percent the following year. The central bank has been trying to balance the need for
economic growth with keeping inflation risks at bay, raising its
main interest rate by 300 basis points to 15.75 percent on Nov 3, the same day it floated the pound. Egypt has held the rates steady since then.  REUTERS
