 London - A boy of 15 sobbed in court on Wednesday as he appeared on charges of killing five people in a car crash. Sporting a black eye and with his left arm in a sling, the slightly-built teenager quietly confirmed his name, address and date of birth. His parents also wept as they sat in front of the dock at Leeds Youth Court. The alleged joyrider, who cannot be identified because of his age, is accused of five counts of causing death by dangerous driving in Leeds on Saturday. He is accused of driving a stolen Renault Clio at 9.54pm when he lost control and hit a tree. The defendant then left the scene, the court heard. Those killed were Ellis Thornton-Kimmitt, 12, his brother Elliott, 14, Darnell Harte, 15, Robbie Meerun, 24, and  Anthoney Armour, 24. Prosecutor David Holderness said the Clio was stolen from a supermarket worker at 4pm, and was being driven at high speed when it crashed, resulting in half the car ‘disappearing’ on impact. The teenager was remanded in custody until he appears before Leeds Crown Court on December 13.   Daily Mail
