Scary stuff, I told myself as I read through the comments. But the transparent luxury capsule that hangs from the top of a mountain in the Sacred Valley of Peru won me over after doing a bit more research about it. Located in the Sacred Valley of Cuzco, Peru, Skylodge Adventure Suites offers guests the chance to capture the breathtaking views of the valley while hanging on top of the mountain. Before you get to the suite, one would have to climb or hike a trail using zip lines. Guests are treated to breakfast and gourmet dinners during their stay. The company Natura Vive is the brainchild behind the suites, which opened in 2013. The Natura Vive Skylodge is composed of three exclusive capsule suites with a total capacity of eight people. Hand-crafted out of aerospace aluminium and weather resistant polycarbonate, each suite comes complete with four beds, a dining area and a private bathroom. If safety is your concern, do not worry. Safety is ensured by having the exit portal located in the upper part of the craft. “The design and features of each suite provides our clients with first-class service and complete comfort,” Natura Vive says on its website. “Our alternative lighting system consists of four interior lamps and a reading light all powered by solar panels that store energy in batteries. Each suite has a private bathroom separated from the bedroom by an insulated wall. Inside is a dry ecological toilet and sink, where you can still enjoy the gorgeous views through the 1.8m diameter dome.”
