Istanbul - Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based media network, says it
is "under cyberattack," amid an ongoing diplomatic crisis between
Doha and other Arab states in the region. "Al Jazeera media platforms under cyberattack. Entire Doha-based
network undergoing 'continual hacking attempts,'" the network said on
its English language new channel's Twitter feed. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Yemen and
Mauritania announced this week they were cutting diplomatic ties and
closing borders with Qatar, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism and
backing Iran. Cyber activities have played a role leading up to the crisis, with
Qatar saying remarks attributed to its leader that angered
neighbouring nations were placed on its national news wire by hackers
and were not true. There have also been leaks of emails of an ambassador from the United
Arab Emirates, which is a key player on the Saudi side. DPA
