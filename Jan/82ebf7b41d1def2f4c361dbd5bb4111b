Johannesburg - Prominent unionist Patrick Craven is leaving the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA). In a statement late on Monday NUMSA General Secretary, Irvin Jim said: &quot;NUMSA On behalf of the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa, I would like to thank Comrade Patrick Craven for his years of service and dedication to the workers movement in general, and to NUMSA in particular&quot;. Jim added: &quot;Although Comrade Craven has been with NUMSA for a short time, he has formally served the South African workers movement since 2000, when he joined COSATU (the Congress of South African Trade Unions) as editor of its magazine, 'The Shopsteward' and later became its spokesperson&quot;. Craven resigned from Cosatu in April 2015, in protest, after the controversial expulsion of general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi. &quot;His time of service in the movement is characterised by his unsurpassed dedication and efficiency. His work ethic is underpinned by a strong sense of principle and commitment,&quot; said Jim.&quot;It was because of his principles that he resigned from COSATU in 2015 following it s degeneration from a militant champion of workers rights, to the tame adjunct of the ruling capitalist class that it is today.&quot; Read also: Numsa launches new labour federationThe NUMSA General Secretary said since then, Craven had worked tirelessly to build the United Front, as well as the establishment of the new, independent, militant, workers-controlled and socialist orientated labour Federation.&quot;On behalf of NUMSA, I wish to congratulate Comrade Craven on his contribution to the workers struggle.
