Redi has been offered a opportunity in the United States in 2018 which will allow her to broaden her broadcast knowledge and expertise. Before she departs, she said she would like to focus her energy and time working on a campaign against sexual violence. Thabisile Mbete,702 station manager, wished Redi all of the best, stating that they have the utmost respect for her. “The good news is that Redi will continue to contribute to Primedia for the foreseeable future, even after she stops doing her regular show. We will continue to work with her as opportunities arise, particularly around social justice issues,” Mbete said Redi said it was with a heavy heart that she'll step down from her show, and from Primedia, which has been her home for 12 years. “In my travels and endeavours, I will keep this amazing place close to my heart." she said. "Primedia and 702 in particular have played a crucial role in the evolution of our democracy and consistently given a voice to the voiceless. The commitment to the country and exercise of independent, hard-hitting but fair journalism make me very proud to have been a part of this great institution.” Redi will still remain on air for the next few months, as her departure from the afternoon drive has not been finalised, which gives the station an opportunity to find a suitable successor.
