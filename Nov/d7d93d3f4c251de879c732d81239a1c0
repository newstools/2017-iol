Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are said to be "back together" after recently spending time with each other. The 'Love Yourself' hitmaker and the 25-year-old singer - who dated on an off from 2011 to 2015 - have reportedly reconciled after recently spending time together, and she is said to have "always had feelings" for the pop star. An insider said: "Selena and Justin are back together. "Selena and The Weeknd just fizzled and ended amicably -- it wasn't dramatic and it wasn't about Justin. But Selena always had feelings for Justin." However, Selena's pals are said to be hoping she treads carefully with the 23-year-old star because she is "in a good place" after undergoing a kidney transplant. The insider added to Us Weekly magazine: "Her friends want her to be cautious because she has been in such a good place post-surgery." This comes after Selena and The Weeknd - whose real name is Abel Tesfaye - called time on their 10-month romance last month. A source close to the situation recently revealed it was the 'I Feel It Coming' hitmaker who instigated their split. The pair are said to have been so busy they'd rarely seen each other in months and had barely been speaking over the phone. The split is said to be completely unrelated to Selena hanging out with Justin once again. Despite this, recent reports have suggested Justin has always been seen as Selena's "soulmate". A source said: "Since things ended with Justin for good, any other guys that Selena dated were placeholders. "All the other guys were just flings. Justin always had her heart and attention. He was always her soulmate and her one true love."
