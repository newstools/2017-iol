Where do you go when you have a demanding family who wants to experience all the activities that Nigeria has to offer while still taking that well deserved break? The answer is Obudu Cattle Ranch. Located in Obudu Plateau in Cross River State, Nigeria, Obudu Mountain Resort is a ranch and resort was developed in 1951 by M. McCaughley. Known as being a mountain resort getaway, this spot has some exciting activities for the whole family. Some of the activities include horseriding, a ride on the cable car to take in the sites and hikes. Just a 30-minute drive from Obudu town, 25 km from Bebi Airstrip and 20 km from Gobbilogo Farm, this Nigeria gem is great for families. Guests who visited seem to love the place too. On TripAdvisor, a public platform where travellers share their experiences on hotels or different tourist spots, Ceejay A said he had a ‘lovely, lovely experience’ that the rooms were lovely. “I went hiking to Igaga water falls, climbed 5 mountains to get there, but it was the most fun thing i've ever done… Another user, Michael E, said: “A true mountain resort. Walk trail, canopy walk, nature reserve, cable car ride, horse ride and above all clean fresh air. Ideal for 3-4 days family stay or business retreat. A loner wouldn't enjoy the place. “Hotel service isn't great but if you love nature and it's offerings, perfect for you. On reservation, ensure you read all correspondence sent to you, ask questions in order to avoid disappointment - light, wifi, telephone service.”
