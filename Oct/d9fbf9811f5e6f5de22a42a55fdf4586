Taunton, Massachusetts - A couple born on the same day at the same Massachusetts hospital have exchanged vows more than two decades later. The two did not grow up together. Aaron Biaros grew up in Taunton, while Jessica Gomes first lived in Raynham and later moved to the city. They met through mutual friends in high school. Jessica says she and Aaron figured out they were born on the same day “pretty early on” when they took a driver's education class together.   Twenty-seven years later, on Saturday, September 9 they finally got married. “I believe in fate and I think that’s part of it,” Jessica said. AP
