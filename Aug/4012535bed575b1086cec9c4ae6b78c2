DURBAN – SuperSport United have signed Sifiso Myeni on loan from Bidvest Wits. Myeni arrived at the Premier Soccer League (PSL) offices in Johannesburg after 8pm. He joined Wits from Orlando Pirates last season, but struggled to find a regular game time at the Clever Boys under Gavin Hunt. Meanwhile, the African News Agency reported that Ajax Cape Town defender Rivaldo Coetzee is set to sign for Mamelodi Sundowns before the transfer window closes on Thursday night. The 20-year-old Bafana Bafana centre-back had been set to join Scottish side Glasgow Celtic last week, but the deal collapsed at a late stage after Ajax had announced the transfer, due to him failing a medical. The Urban Warriors subsequently sent the player to two specialists in Cape Town, who reported that the player’s foot issue is not necessarily as serious as the Celtic doctors claimed. But it looks like Coetzee will be playing his football out of Tshwane rather than Cape Town if a report by local publication Soccer Laduma is accurate, as it claimed that Ajax and Sundowns have agreed to terms. The same publication subsequently stated that there could be a swap deal on the cards, with Ajax getting Sundowns defender Mario Booysen and an extra cash payment in return for Coetzee joining Pitso Mosimane’s African champions.
