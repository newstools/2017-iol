The first lady of Football sports casting Carol Tshabalala  took some  some much deserved downtime in the ever so beautiful Mozambique earlier this week.  Tshabalala who is known for her work as one of the country’s top football touchline and in-studio presenters is no stranger to travelling, with her having recently returned from the UK where she presents a football show about the British Premier League..  In a series of Instagram posts that have us green with envy, Tshabalala has posted some of her moments in the country. Pictured with her in some of the posts are children,  so it looks to us like this was a family vacation.  From eating delectable seafood, exploring the tent lifestyle to breathtaking sunset images, Simply Carol looked to be living simply the life. Follow her on @simplycarol8 and the hashtag #CarolInMoz and see for yourself! One of the beaches in Mozambique where Carol Tshabalala is currently holidaying .
