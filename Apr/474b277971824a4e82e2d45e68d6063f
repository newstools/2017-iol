Enjoy juicy strips of salmon drenched in a thick red curry sauce, served with a punchy Thai basil and chilli garnish- flavour-packed, vibrant and satisfying. Ingredients 2 x skin-on, boneless salmon fillets (around 260g) 50g red curry paste 150ml coconut milk and 2 tsp coconut milk 1 tbsp fish sauce 1 tbsp sugar Juice of half a lime 2 pinches of salt 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil ½ tbsp ginger, finely grated 60g Thai basil, finely shredded ½ a red chilli, finely sliced Steamed rice, to serve Method In a small bowl (or pestle and mortar), mash together the basil, chilli and ginger. Heat the curry paste in a wok over a medium heat until it starts to separate, then add the 150ml coconut milk, fish sauce, sugar, and lime juice. Stir to combine, and then keep the sauce uncovered and simmering while you cook the salmon. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat. When the oil shimmers and you can see a faint swirl of smoke, sprinkle a pinch of salt onto the skin side of each salmon fillet. Turn the heat down to medium, then add the fillets to the pan skin side down. Push down on the fillets with a spatula to keep the skin in close contact with the pan. Cook for five or six minutes, then flip and cook on the fleshy side for one minute. By now the sauce should be thick and glossy. Serve the crispy-skinned salmon with rice, a generous drizzle of sauce, and a spoonful of the ginger, basil and chilli mixture. Finish with an extra drizzle of coconut milk, if you wish. *recipe by The Dumpling Sisters
