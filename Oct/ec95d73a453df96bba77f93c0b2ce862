Orange County, California - This is bespoke automaker Rezvani’s first SUV, the Tank, a seriously hard-core off-roader that’s intended to look like a military vehicle on the outside, but with luxury accommodation inside. That includes hand-stitched full leather trim, a suede headliner, head-up display and a 20cm infotainment screen on the centre stack with a full suite of on and off-road navigation apps already installed. Then it gets hard-core: tough body on frame construction, long-travel suspension and on demand all-wheel drive with locking differentials. But it’s what’s under the bonnet that defines this brutal beetle-crusher - a 6.4-litre Chrysler Hemi V8 rated at 373kW and 583Nm. Standard kit includes LED foglights at the base of the grille and a roof-mounted LED light bar; extra-cost options include a tow bar and front-mounted winch, auto-extending side steps, thermal night-vision cameras, military grade run-flat tyres, Kevlar armoured body panels, bullet-proof glass and kevlar underbody protection for the fuel tank, floorpan and radiator. The optional Off-Road Package adds 150mm of additional ride height, Dynatrac ProRock 44/60 axles with electronic locking differentials, 65mm diameter Fox remote reservoir shocks and 37 inch 315/85 - 15 off-road tyres. Finally the optional Off-Road Extreme Package includes Dynatrac ProRock XD60/80 axles with pneumatic locking differentials and an air compressor, Dynatrac ProGrip front and rear brakes, 65mm diameter internal bypass Fox shocks with dynamic stability control and 37 inch 345/75 - 15 tyres. Prices ex works start at $178 500 (R2.43 million) and first deliveries are scheduled for late 2017.   IOL Motoring
