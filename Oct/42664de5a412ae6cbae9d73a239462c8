Instead of having to make the nerve-rattling decision to choose just one of the scores of amazing eateries to spend the Sunday mid-morning and into lunch, The Lady and I opted instead to change venues per course. Who would’ve thought you could get awesome Mexican munchies in French corner? Tuk Tuk is a quaint micro-brewery on Franschhoek’s main road. They produce four beers - a lager, a dark Dunkel, a fresh, light Weizen, and a fruity, zesty, refreshing pale ale with a bitter finish. And their Mexican food is to die for. You’ll find crispy, spicy chicken wings, tender on the inside, served with a delicious ranch dressing and a delectably fresh cucumber salad with yoghurt, coriander, celery and lime; seared tuna as well as beef tacos; yummy burgers; and mouth-watering quesadillas. Washed down with a sample tasting of their craft beer, the chicken wings were the perfect starter for our Franschhoek culinary adventure and a feast for the taste buds. The brewing tanks are visible from the chic, copper and brass interior dining area, while you’re shielded from the harsh African sun by umbrellas on their patio. The bathrooms are pretty neat, too - they’ve got draught taps above the basin instead of normal taps. Cape Argus
