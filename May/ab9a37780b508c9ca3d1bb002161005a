Mukilteo, Washington – As spectacular as this dashcam video by Guanting Li is (and remember, this is for real, not movie footage) the most amazing thing about this rush-hour fireball is that nobody was hurt. Apparently the pilot of this Piper Cherokee Six lost power shortly after take-off and tried to put the aircraft down on a Mukilteo street, but clipped a powerline and then a traffic light as he lost height, slicing open the plane’s fuel tank. That caused a huge burst of flame – and also set a car on fire – but the fuselage of the Cherokee Six stayed largely intact and everybody walked away unharmed.
