Beijing - Ten bodies were pulled from the wreckage of a central
 Chinese hotel flattened by a landslide this week, bringing the
confirmed death toll to 12, Xinhua reported Sunday. Two deaths had already been confirmed after the Friday accident in
Hunan province, according to Xinhua. The first two people reported
dead had initially survived the accident, but died later in hospital. There are three confirmed survivors. Most of those caught up in the
landslide were guests at the hotel. The hotel was hit on Friday by piles of rocks and debris from a
landslide, according to the report. One of the boulders that hit the
hotel reportedly weighed 150 tons. The cause of the accident is being investigated, but the area is
prone to landslides, especially during heavy rainfall. dpa
