“I’m a performer. People mustn’t think I lip sync only, people must know that I'm Babes Wodumo.” She’s only joking, of course, but Isibaya star Jessica Nkosi is keen to let the world know that she is a triple threat. Although she lost to Nandi Madida on the recent episode of Lip Sync Battle Africa, Jessica nailed both her performances like a pro. Jessica is set to star in a theatrical musical where she will show off her singing, dancing and acting talent. “People must know that I sing and dance,” she said. “I’m a performer. I will start rehearsals next month (June) and it will be in one of the theaters in Joburg.”  Meanwhile, she assured fans that popular Isibaya character Qondi would be making a comeback. “My fans fans would kill me, but no, Qondi is not gone. She will be back for sure, although I cannot confirm when, but she'll be back in few months.” Cassper, Black Coffee back Babes on #Dololo See how Jessica dazzled at the SAMAs red carpet in Sun City this past weekend.
