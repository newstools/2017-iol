Catching Feelings, by comedian Kagiso Lediga, won the award for best South African feature film. On Saturday night the festival announced the award winners at the closing ceremony, held at a red carpet event at the Westin Hotel. The gathering was a collaborative effort with the City of Cape Town, Wesgro and the festival board. They aimed to create a festival that not only celebrated the art of film, but also presented an active trading platform for local and international industry stakeholders. Festival director Leon 
van der Merwe said: “The festival has definitely been a success, not only with the screenings, but also the seminars and training sessions. We strive to make it more relevant and bigger for the following year,” said Van der Merwe. “If there is something I would change it is that I would like to have more films from young directors, what we call the new voices. If I can have more films from those young voices in the festival I would be ecstatic,” he said. The 16 judges who determined the award winners are said to be international experts. The jury members selected their best films which resonated 
with them and which they felt should be seen by other people or were worthy of being awarded, Van der Merwe explained. “Each jury member has their own set of criteria, but then they get together to discuss each jury member’s selection for a certain category and they work it out from there,” he said.
