Travellers to Saudi Arabia, including myself, have something to look forward to when The Red Sea development is complete. The development that was announced earlier this month is expected to bring in billions to the local economy. It  will consists of luxury resorts across 50 islands, nature reserves, dormant volcanoes and historical heritage sites. Dubbed as ‘unforgetable’ on its video, The Red Sea project  will be developed along a 200 km stretch of land that will draw in many tourists, create 35 000 jobs and be home to some of the world’s best hotels, residences and transport hubs. The development will stretch across more than 50 natural islands between the cities of Umluj and Al-Wajh, a few kilometres from one of the kingdom's protected reserves and extinct volcanoes in Harrat Al-Rahat area. Foundations will be laid in the third quarter of 2019 with the first phase completed in the final quarter of 2022. While no official pictures of how it will look after completion, I am excited that this project will draw more tourists to the Rea Sea. For full video, visit: https://youtu.be/uToNZvEpXXE
