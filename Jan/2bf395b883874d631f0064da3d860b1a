Cape Town - The stage is set for the Sun Met celebrated with Mumm which takes place at Kenilworth Racecourse on Saturday.Last year 32 000 people attended the Met and this year they are expecting no fewer, said Garth Petersen, event manager for Kenilworth Racing.Public parking will be at Chukker Road. Tickets cost R70 and can be bought at Ticketpro or at the gate. Shuttles and buses for the public will be available from 10am until midnight. No roads will be closed. Petersen, however, has asked that nobody stop along Rosmead Avenue and rather get dropped off at the Wetton Road entrance.There is hospitality VIP parking. Vehicle access is from the southern end of Chukker Road. We would prefer people not to drink and drive but rather use Uber or taxis. The weather will be around 24&deg;C, but in the event of rain, some people will get wet, said Petersen. There are marquees, big umbrellas and people can take shelter under the grandstands, but there isn t much protection. There have been no applications for helicopters to land, but this could change on the day, he said. &nbsp;Cape Argus
