 London - Queen Elizabeth II’s cousin and best friend Margaret Rhodes left £132 000 (R2 121 000) in her will. Probate records show Mrs Rhodes, who died aged 91 in November after a short illness, left the bulk of her estate to her four children. She was the youngest daughter of the Queen Mother’s older sister and became the Queen’s friend and confidante when they played together as children. Mrs Rhodes lived until her death in a grace and favour home in Windsor Great Park, making her a neighbour of the Queen, who visited regularly. She was a bridesmaid at the royal wedding in 1947.
