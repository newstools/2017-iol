ATZENBRUGG, Austria – South Africa’s Dylan Frittelli won his maiden European Tour title on Sunday, a final round of 5-under-par 67 allowing him to triumph by one shot at the Austrian Open. Frittelli, 27, carded six birdies and one bogey to finish 12-under-par, one stroke clear of England’s David Horsey, Finland’s Mikko Korhonen and his fellow South African Jbe Kruger. Once a playing partner of Jordan Spieth while at college in the United States, Frittelli lost in a playoff in the China Open in April, and now has a Tour victory to his name. He almost found himself in another playoff this time, but Kruger’s own fine round was tarnished by a bogey at the last, a 67 seeing him fall one shot shy. “I’m really happy with the way the week went – super stoked to get my first win on the European Tour – I think it’s been a long time coming, and I am glad to be inside the winner’s circle,” Frittelli told the europeantour.com website.   Sitting 17th in the Race to Dubai, the win boosts his chances of qualifying for next month’s Open Championship at Royal Birkdale. “Hopefully I get into The Open with this performance, and it should move me up the Race to Dubai and open up some more doors down the road,” he added. He had started the day on 7-under, two shots behind overnight leader Felipe Aguilar. The Chilean had led after each of the opening three rounds, but fell away after carding five bogeys in a 3-over-par round of 75. He finished tied for 10th on 6-under-par, while Frittelli birdied three of the first four holes and recovered from a wobble at the start of the back nine to see out the victory. A birdie at 16 and then two pars to finish allowed him to hold off Kruger. Horsey, who matched the course record with an 8-under 64 on Friday, produced a flawless final round of 65, featuring seven birdies, but fell just short.
