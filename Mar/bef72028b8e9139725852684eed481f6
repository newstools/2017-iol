The Financial Services Board (FSB) warns you to be cautious if you receive correspondence from a certain Barr Fred Reagan, who purports to be the personal assistant of Rosemary Hunter at the FSB. Reagan misleads people into believing unclaimed pension fund benefits are due to them. The FSB says it has no connection with Reagan. Hunter is the FSBâ€™s former deputy registrar of retirement funds. If you believe there are unclaimed retirement fund benefits due to you, you should contact the FSB directly, either on its toll-free number, 0800 110 443, or on the website, www.fsb.co.za.
