DURBAN – Only SuperSport United can spoil the party for Baroka FC, who are set to become the champions for the first quarter (Q1) of the Absa Premiership season. The Limpopo-based team already completed their set of eight games, with the club attaining 16 points, before their 1-0 loss to Bidvest Wits on Sunday. Mamelodi Sundowns are now out of the race for Q1 – and the R1.5 million prize that comes with it – after suffering a 2-1 loss to AmaZulu on Saturday. The gap between Sundowns and Baroka is seven points. The former African champions are left with two matches in Q1, and even if they triumph in those two games, they won’t reach the tally that has been set by Kgoloko Thobejane’s Baroka. Sundowns can only get to 15 points after eight matches if they win their next two league encounters. They will face Orlando Pirates on November 1 at Orlando Stadium, and then visit Wits away on November 21. SuperSport need to collect at least nine points in their last four matches if they are to be crowned the champions of Q1. If they collect nine points in their last four outings, they will be tied with Baroka on 16 points, and the goal difference will decide the winner. SuperSport can get up to 17 points if they win all four their remaining matches in Q1. Matsatsantsa A Pitori are behind the other teams due to their Caf Confederation Cup commitments. SuperSport will face Lamontville Golden Arrows in their next league match on October 31 at Lucas Moripe Stadium. They will follow that with another home encounter against Ajax Cape Town at Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit on November 22, followed by Polokwane City at Lucas Moripe Stadium three days later. Matsatsantsa A Pitori will close their Q1 against Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on December 5. SuperSport have already pocketed R8 million this season for winning the MTN8. @Minenhlecr7  IOL Sport
