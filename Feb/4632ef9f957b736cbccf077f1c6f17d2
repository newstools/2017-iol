Boca Raton, Florida â€“ A Maserati is missing after a man allegedly conned a salesman during a test drive. Boca Raton police say a 45-year-old man went to a dealership to test drive a Maserati GranTurismo. He and a salesman drove to a marina so he could supposedly show his girlfriend the car. They walked down the dock, then he told the salesman he would get his girlfriend. When he didn't return after 30 minutes, the salesman searched for the man. The valet then told him that he'd driven off. However, the alleged thief was arrested on Wednesday on car theft charges, one day later, but the car wasn't found. At the time of writing he was being held by federal authorities on a probation violation. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
