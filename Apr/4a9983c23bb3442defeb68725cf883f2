MKMVA chairman Kebby Maphatsoe said members of the ANC were gathered to celebrate the President's birthday which has nothing to do with the march. "The right to march was fought for by our leaders such as Nelson Mandela...blood was spilt, so that has no impact on us here at all," Maphatsoe said on the sidelines of the event. ANC deputy secretary Jessie Duarte and Congress of South African Trade Unions president Sidumo Dlamini had arrived ahead of Zuma.
