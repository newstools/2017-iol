Johannesburg The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) in North West have arrested one of the province's most wanted suspects who is allegedly linked to a number of cases of ATM bombing, cash-in-transit heists and hijacking. In a statement, Hawks spokesman Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso, said the suspect was arrested on Thursday at the Witbank Magistrate's Court while making an appearance for a case of cash-in-transit that took place in Witbank in January 2016.&nbsp;&quot;The arrest emanated from intensive investigations by the Hawks, following two incidents of ATM bombings that took place in June 2016 at different Standard Bank ATMs in Christiana,&quot; said Rikhotso. According to Rikhotso, the suspect was once caught in the act at one of the ATMs. However, he allegedly opened fire at the police before driving off in a white VW Golf 7 GTI with an estimated value of over R600,000. &quot;The vehicle was later found abandoned in Orkney. Through investigations, the vehicle was linked to a case of hijacking and attempted murder that took place in Mpumalanga late in 2015.&quot; Rikhotso said investigations were on-going and the suspect could be linked to more cases of ATM bombing around the country. The suspect is set to appear on Monday at Christiana Magistrate's Court where he will be facing charges related to ATM bombings. African News Agency
