Johannesburg - Anxious parents were on Tuesday queuing inside and outside the Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) offices in the hope of getting their children placed in schools before opening day. Schools in Gauteng open on Wednesday.&nbsp; &quot;I have been here since 7am, I applied in May online for my son to go to a school in Westernaria because he has been schooling there,&quot; said a mother, who asked not to be named.&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The system said he was accepted, but when I went to the school I'm told there is no space and I must come to the department. I'm a teacher myself, I should be at school now as well.&quot;&nbsp; In 2016 the GDE introduced online registration for learners going to grade one and grade eight.&nbsp; &quot;This online registration was very complicated and data is expensive, the department must make a plan... I pay tax and I want my child to go to school in Lenasia South. If my child doesn't get a school then I will stop voting. What's the point,&quot; said a mother of a grade eight learner.&nbsp; MEC for education, Panyaza Lesufi, on Monday said those who had made late applications were not likely to get places before March.&nbsp; African News Agency
