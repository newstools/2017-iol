Gothenburg, Sweden – Volvo is getting ready to pull the covers off its all-new XC60 and the teaser pictures released thus far show a strong family resemblance to its award-winning big brother, the XC90. As you would have expected, the new mid-sized SUV has ‘Thor’s Hammer’ headlights, but unlike in the XC90, they flow into the grille, which is also characteristically Volvo with its broad rectangular shape. It is believed that the newcomer will be built on Volvo’s SPA modular architecture that underpins the XC90 and S90/V90 and motivation will almost certainly come from a selection of the turbo-charged 2-litre petrol and diesel engines that power its platform partners. The XC60 is also likely to have inherited the 90 family’s semi-autonomous driving systems, but we’ll have to wait for the full reveal at the Geneva Motor Show on March 7 to find out all the nitty gritty.
