Harare - Zimbabwe's largest mobile telephony company Econet Wireless plans to raise $130 million from shareholders to pay &nbsp;foreign loans it is struggling to settle due to a severe dollar crunch, it said on Tuesday.&nbsp; Econet said in a statement that to avoid defaulting on external obligations, it had decided to raise money via a rights issue, adding that foreign currency shortages made it difficult for the company and its subsidiaries to pay foreign loans.&nbsp; The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe last November introduced a &quot;bond note&quot; currency to ease chronic cash shortages, but long queues have remained at banks, which have continued to impose stringent limits on cash withdrawals.&nbsp; The $130 million is the largest amount that any Zimbabwean company has attempted to raise from shareholders since the southern African nation dumped its inflation-ravaged currency for the US dollar in 2009, according to stock exchange data.&nbsp; Read also: Econet's Neotel deal could drive competition&quot;To avoid defaulting on its loan obligations, the company intends to raise foreign currency from its members by way of a rights offer of shares and linked debentures,&quot; Econet said.&nbsp; Shareholders would buy shares at a discounted price of 5 cents, compared to the share price of 30 cents at Monday's closing price on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Reuters
