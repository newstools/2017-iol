Johannesburg - Civil society on Monday launched a coalition named Future South Africa (FutureSA) and immediately called on South Africans to participate in a national shut down in support of the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. Zuma faces a no confidence vote in Parliament on August 8, amid growing concerns of endless reports of possible corruption linked to the wealthy and controversial Gupta brothers. Patrons who attended the launch held at the Ahmed Kathrada Auditorium in Auckland Park included Sheila Sisulu, who was the first female black person to represent South Africa as an ambassador to the United States. Leader of the newly formed newly-formed South African Federation of Trade Unions, Zwelinzima Vavi, was also in attendance. "We are calling for a lunchtime shutdown on August 8. From 12pm to 2pm we want ordinary people -- be they at home, at the work place or school, to take to the streets and make their voices heard. For those in Cape Town, we urge the march to Parliament against Zuma," said the FutureSA patrons in a prepared statement. "We must put pressure on MPs, vote for the constitution and your children," Vavi implored. "This is about the future of South Africa." The patrons said as elected representatives, MPs, were "duty bound" to vote Zuma out of office to save the country from corruption and state capture. "The National Day of No Confidence must be the start of that process, one in which citizens come together to demand clean governance and in effect, a better future for our children." The patrons include Bruce Fordyce, Wayne Duvenage, Mavuso Msimang, Kumi Naidoo, Adrian Enthoven, Prema Naidoo, Shaukat Fakie, Giet Khoza, Cas Coovadia, Mosibudi Mangena, Vuyiseka Dubula, Sydney Mufamadi, Sipho Pityana, Ela Gandhi, Bonang Mohale, Terrence Nombembe and Zac Yakoob.
