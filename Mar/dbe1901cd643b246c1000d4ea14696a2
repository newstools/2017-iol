Customers of older cars often feel all but forgotten by the manufacturer, but Toyota is aiming to turn the tide on this notion with discounted servicing for all Toyota vehicles that are older than five years. The new Toyota Value Service, as it’s called, guarantees customers a minimum discount of 10 percent on replacement parts, in addition to gearbox oil, engine coolant and brake fluid, as well as a capped labour rate. This applies to all Toyota vehicles older than five years, regardless of their mileage, and providing that the prescribed service schedules are followed, the dealers also offer a one-year warranty on parts and workmanship. Toyota also offers a vehicle-specific online service calculator that gives customers an idea of which parts need replacing at the next service and what it’s likely to cost and so on. Just have your registration or VIN number handy. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
