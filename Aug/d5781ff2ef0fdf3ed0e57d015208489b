JOHANNESBURG - JSE-listed Exxaro Resources said, that it expects to generate between R2.4 billion and R2.8 billion in earnings for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017. The South African coal and heavy minerals mining company said the windfall was mainly due to higher net operating profit contribution from the coal business as well as higher equity-accounted income from investments.
