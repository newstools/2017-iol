Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - New Zealander Brendon Hartley will start his fourth race in Formula One with a fourth grid penalty after his Toro Rosso team replaced part of his car’s Renault power unit for Sunday’s season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The 28-year-old double world endurance champion and Le Mans 24 Hours sports-car winner made his F1 debut with a 25 place penalty at the United States Grand Prix in October. Hartley was then handed a 20 place demotion in Mexico and another penalty in Brazil as the Red Bull-owned team wrestled with engine reliability. Formula One technical delegate Jo Bauer said on Friday Toro Rosso had replaced the motor generator unit-heat in Hartley’s car, which recovers energy from the exhaust. That breach will incur a 10 place penalty. Toro Rosso is sixth in the Constructors’ championship, four points clear of Renault and a further two ahead of Haas. Reuters
