Johannesburg The Free State arm of the South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) is calling on Eskom to suspend the decision to cut the electricity supply to municipalities in the province.The organisation argues there are other ways to go about recuperating the money other than switching off power. Eskom should note that basic services such as water and electricity are essential to our communities and institutions such as clinics and hospitals [which] will suffer due to this decision. SANCO s statement follows a January 5 decision by the North Gauteng High Court to dismiss, with costs, AfriForum's application to prevent Eskom from cutting off power of more than 7 municipalities who are billions of rand in arrears.AfriForum and AfriBusiness sought to interdict Eskom's planned reduction of the supply of electricity to the defaulting municipalities in the Free State, North West, Mpumalanga and Northern Cape provinces. Eskom said the amount owed had risen to R10.2 billion, which had grown over the past eight months from R6 billion.In the last five years, the overdue debt had increased tenfold, with the March 2017 forecast being in excess of R12 billion.Read also: Eskom will cut off defaulting municipalitiesIn a statement after the ruling, Eskom said that in making his ruling, Judge Hans Fabricius had said that it was necessary to appreciate the context in which Eskom operated in the national economy, seen against the background of its Constitutional rights and obligations.According to Eskom, Fabricius also acknowledged that Eskom had consulted all the municipalities and relevant stakeholders extensively since 2011.However, SANCO says it is government s moral duty, as enshrined in the Constitution, to ensure that everyone has access to the basic services they need to improve their lives. SANCO notes that even those communities who pay electricity will be affected. Sanco calls on residents who are in arrears to pay their services and those who are unemployed to visit municipal offices for the indegency register. SANCO adds cutting off electricity will not only affect people, but also the economy and jobs. The decision will further add to negative investor confidence in the province. If companies are not getting electricity they will not pay other taxes and it will result to increase of high unemployment rate which this country is facing. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
