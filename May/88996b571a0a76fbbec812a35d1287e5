Spielberg, Austria – What do Formula One drivers do on their day off?  In the case of Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen, they hitch a couple of caravans to two Aston Martin supercars and race them around their home circuit, the Red Bull Ring! OK, it was all a stunt to publicise the upcoming Austrian Grand Prix in July, and the two drivers could hardly stop laughing the whole time – but there was nothing funny about the cars. Ricciardo was driving a 423kW Vanquish Volante, and Verstappen a 443kW Vanquish S Volante, each completely standard apart from a factory option towbar. The caravans, each of which weighed about 400kg, were fitted with Pirelli slicks in an attempt to keep them from trying to overtaking the tow-cars in corners, but it didn’t help – neither survived the race.
