Calling all ‘original’ plane-spotters, wannabe’s and kulula.com fans in and around South Africa! kulula, South Africa’s most fun airline is at it again and we want you to #lookup, cause our brand new sexy aircraft paint design ‘Flying 102’ has got the ultimate swag, flying all over South Africa. The aircraft depicts the ultimate kulula tongue-in-cheek phrase guide that gives travellers the 102 about the various parts of the plane. Some of the phrases on this particular aircraft includes the ‘No Red-Light District Here’ and ‘Complimentary Darth-Vader Mouth Caps’. "We are very lucky to have got the opportunity to repaint and have some fun with our spare aircraft, which will now be better known as ‘Flying 102'. This aircraft is a limited edition and the second brainchild of kulula's in-house design department and will be the last of its kind as all our brand-new aircrafts come with a standard paint scheme straight off the assembly line. ‘Flying 102’ is once again here to give all kulula fans and plane enthusiasts the inside info when it comes to all the nooks and crannies that you will find on one of our kulula aircrafts in the signature kulula way," comments Luane Lavery, Brand Communications Manager at kulula.com. "Its sibling, 'Flying 101' became a global hit and we are still amused by the number of responses that we have received since it took to the skies in 2010. We hope our fans will enjoy the new funky and truly South African aircraft paint design. Flying 102 will be in operation from today and will ‘shine bright like the African sun’ in ‘the colour of champions’ and we put out a challenge to all travellers to become plane-spotters and enjoy in the excitement with us as we ‘thrust you like never before’!” The side of the aircraft with nifty labeling to show where all the important bits of the plane are.
