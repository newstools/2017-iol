CAPE TOWN - Isolezwe - a subsidiary of Independent Media has launched a new digital platform that will run complementary with its print daily publication. The website dedicated to Zulu readers is aimed at capturing the youthful audience with daily and trending topical news. Group Executive of Digital, Walter Madzonga said, "We are excited about the launch of a dedicated Zulu website to compliment the success of the daily newspaper. The launch of the site is an important step as approximately 22% (12 million people) of the South African population speak Zulu as a first language". Besides reaching the massive Zulu audiences, the publication's revenues will also gain boost through the online related business. Isolezwe Content Producer, Mcebo Mpungose said, "When we made the move to build our digital platform, it was the case of combining the old, which is Iphepha lethu (our newspaper) and the new, which is what people want online". Mpungose also said that fulfilling their readers' needs has always contributed to the stability of their print publication. The publication wants its readers to feel in control and own a portion of the content. ALSO READ: Pointers SA takes digital to townships "We have plans to draw on User Generated Content.
