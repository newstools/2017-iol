Themba Mavundla, KwaZulu-Natal chairperson of the MKMVA, had told delegates at the ANC KZN provincial general council at the University of Zululand, Empangeni, that they should be ready to defend the country from military-trained white people. He had said MKMVA members and President Jacob Zuma had military skills to share with young people. However, Mkhize called Mavundla to order, saying that such statements would send the wrong message about the party. Mavundla warned that “Boers are training in farms”. “Young people, Boers are reorganising... Come closer to us so that we can provide you with little military skills so that you can defend yourself. “We are ready as the MKMVA in KwaZulu-Natal. Before President Jacob Zuma falls, we must have done this and pass over this art (of war) to the youth for the future of this congress movement. We need this otherwise this country will be taken,” he said to applause. Mkhize called on young people to join legal structures such as the SANDF and SAPS. He was standing in for Zuma, who arrived late after being delayed in Swaziland. “I am mentioning this because I don’t want us to have a situation later that becomes a challenge,” he said. Mkhize also called for unity within the party, saying the ANC should defend itself against attacks from ever-growing opposition forces, some of which had emerged within the party and the alliance.
