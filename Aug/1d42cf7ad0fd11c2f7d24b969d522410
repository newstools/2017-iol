The most powerful and luxurious version of the full-sized Range Rover is set to make its South African debut at the South African Motoring Experience at Kyalami this weekend. A product of the British carmaker’s Special Vehicle Operations, the Range Rover SV Autobiography Dynamic, inherits the most powerful version of JLR’s supercharged V8 engine, as fitted to the Range Rover Sport SVR. In this form, the 5-litre engine produces 405kW and 680Nm, enough to launch the 2360kg behemoth from 0-100km/h in just 5.5 seconds, according to manufacturer claims. The dynamic package is rounded off by an 8mm-lower ride height, adaptive suspension, 21 or 22-inch wheels and uprated Brembo brakes. The cabin gets the full red carpet Autobiography treatment with diamond-quilted leather that can be ordered in four bespoke colour schemes, as well as knurled aluminium finishes on the dials and pedals, an Ebony perforated leather headliner and Brand Black veneer fascia and door casings. This Rangie also gets JLR’s latest InControl Touch Pro infotainment package, featuring a 25cm touchscreen and a range of new apps that let you remotely switch on the climate control to heat or cool the interior, and even start the engine, before you get there, set the alarm and warn you if the alarm's been triggered. The Range Rover SV Autobiography Dynamic retails at R3 082 128 in standard-length guise and R3 688 128 in long-wheelbase form. Jaguar Land Rover will use the Kyalami-based motor show to offer consumers and media various on-track and off-road driving experiences in a variety of products, including the new Range Rover SV Autobiography and the 2018 model year Jaguar F-Type. Watch this space for driving impressions of the SVA and F-Type in about a week from now. IOL Motoring
