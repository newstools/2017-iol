Geneva Motor Show – Nissan’s Qashqai has been given a midlife makeover that gives it a fresh new look as well as a smoother ride, better noise insulation and new driver assistance gadgets, including the semi-autonomous ProPilot system. Though you’re still required to be fully alert, with your hands on the wheel at all times, ProPilot will make life easier by helping drivers with the steering, acceleration and braking in a single lane on highways. Other new features include Rear Cross Traffic Alert and a Pedestrian Recognition function for the Intelligent Emergency Braking system. Upfront the Qashqai has been redesigned with a much larger ‘V-Motion’ grille that conforms to Nissan’s latest corporate look and the headlights, while retaining their familiar shape, get a new inner design with a more prominent ‘boomerang’ signature. At the back, that ‘boomerang’ theme now extends across the full length of the revised, 3D-effect tail lamps. Rounding off the visual changes are a new range of alloy wheels (17- to 19-inches in diameter) and two new colours: Vivid Blue (as per the pictures) and Chestnut Bronze. The cabin remains mostly unchanged, but there is a new flat-bottomed steering wheel. There’s also a new interface for the NissanConnect infotainment system. And, in Europe at least, there’s a new range-topping Tekna+ grade that features nappa-leather-covered seats with a ‘3D’ quilting effect. With European sales commencing in July, South Africa’s cars are likely to arrive later in the year – we’re currently awaiting confirmation from Nissan SA. The turbo engine range continues as before, offering 1.2 and 1.6 petrols as well as 1.5 and 1.6 diesel units. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
