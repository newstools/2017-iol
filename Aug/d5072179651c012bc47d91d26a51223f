Johannesburg - American drift master Ken Block will be back in South Africa this November when the head Hoonigan and his merry band of pro-powersliders stage the final round of the 2017 Gymkhana Grid series at Carnival City. Now in its sixth year, Gymkhana Grid is an international racing series like no other, mixing a traditional side-by-side gymkhana course with drifting, and throwing in a dash of donuts for good measure. Competitors such as Block, former WRC champion Petter Solberg, Luke Woodham and Andreas Bakkerud will dice side-by-side against local drivers Jason Webb, Des Gutzeit and Paolo Gouveia, nailing clipping points and shredding tread in both all- or rear-wheel drive cars until an eventual winner is named. “Gymkhana GRiD has been growing year on year," Block said, "and to have it expand to an incredible country like South Africa is very exciting. “When I was last there for Clarkson, Hammond and May Live in 2016 my team and I had such a warm welcome. South Africans are very passionate about motorsport, and I enjoyed my time down there a lot. We have some big plans in place for the Grid track this year - it’s going to bigger and better than ever before!” The season-ending Grid round will be run at Carnival City on 18 and 19 November. Tickets are on sale now at www.ticketpros.co.za and are priced at R415 for standing and R580 for general admission. VIP tickets which include preferential seating, food and drinks and a take-home Grid seat cushion are R980.   IOL Motoring
