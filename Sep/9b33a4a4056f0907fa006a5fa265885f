Pretoria - Holders of the Zimbabwean special permit (ZSP) due to expire on December 31, 2017 are now able to apply for the new Zimbabwean exemption permit (ZEP) as announced by Home Affairs Minister Hlengiwe Buhle Mkhize.
 
The online ZEP application process opened on Friday and would close on Thursday, November 30, VFS Global said in a statement. The new ZEP dispensation was valid for four years and would allow ZSP holders to continue to work, study, and run businesses in South Africa. Holders of ZSP’s would be required to complete the process individually which would include a personal appointment for registration of biometric data.   
 
As with the similar and successful ZSP programme introduced in August 2014, applications would be facilitated online on the VFS Global website, but the adjudication thereof would be handled by the home affairs department (DHA).
 
“Our visa centres and staff are ready to handle the volume of applications and call centre queries,” VFS Global chief operations officer for Africa Jiten Vyas said.  “We are making every effort to ensure a seamless application process that is an easy and effective experience. Our hope is that all ZSP holders apply for ZEP and complete the process by the end of November 2017 so they can move freely between Zimbabwe and their places of study, work, or business located in South Africa,” Vyas said.
 
All ZEP applicants should visit www.vfsglobal.com/ZEP/SouthAfrica to fill in the online application form individually and make payment individually. The DHA was facilitating dedicated ZEP application centres through its partnership with VFS Global.  Conditions of the new ZEP dispensation:
* Entitles the holder to work/ study and/or conduct business;

* Will not be renewable/extendable;
