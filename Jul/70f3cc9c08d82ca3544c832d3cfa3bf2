Rustenburg - Two decomposed bodies were found along the the Parys-Fochville road, North West police said on Thursday. Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the bodies of unknown men were found on July 4. "According to information available at this stage, it appears that the pair, both males, were shot on the back of their heads. The victims are estimated to be between the ages of 35 and 40.  One of the them was wearing a blue shirt. The other one was burnt beyond recognition apparently due to the recent veld fire at the farm where they were found. At this stage the motive of the incident is unknown," he said.
 
Mokgwabone urged anyone with information that may lead to identification of the men or tracing of their families members to contact the police. African News Agency
