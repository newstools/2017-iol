The provisional curator of troubled Community Medical Aid Scheme (Commed), Deon van Wyk, has, acting on instruction from the Registrar of Medical Schemes, negotiated with Bonitas Medical Fund that all Commed members be moved to Bonitas with effect from today, August 7, 2017. In terms of an agreement reached between Commed and Bonitas, members will be moved without underwriting and without waiting periods being applied, meaning they will transfer to Bonitas without a break in cover. All claims payable in terms of services obtained by members until August 6, 2017 will be paid by Commed, and all claims incurred from today, August 7, will be covered by Bonitas. Members who do not want to remain with Bonitas or who want to change their allocated Bonitas benefit option will be free to do so by informing Bonitas accordingly. The schemes are confident that the move of the Commed members to Bonitas is in the interests of the members to ensure that members do not find themselves without medical cover. Bonitas welcomes to Commed members to its family, it says, and assures its existing members that the scheme will continue to grow for the benefit of all members.
