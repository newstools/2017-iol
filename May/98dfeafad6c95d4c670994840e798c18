Cape Town - Parliament has taken action against the Black First Land First (BLF) of Andile Mngxitama after it disrupted the meeting of the joint committees on finance and trade and industry last week.  At the meeting of the programming committee on Thursday MPs expressed disgust at the conduct of the BLF and Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli called for the organisation to apologise to MPs.  Tsenoli said the BLF must apologise to Parliament failing which, further action will be taken against the organisation.  The programming committee said it was unacceptable that the BLF was invited to Parliament to make a submission on financial sector transformation but ended up disrupting the proceedings of the House.  It said action was needed, but it would have to make an apology to Parliament.  Political Bureau
