Amsterdam - Dutch prosecutors said they
were considering charging an Amsterdam Airbnb property owner
with attempted murder after he allegedly pushed a guest down a
flight of stairs in a row about the check-out time. Police said the alleged victim, South African woman Siba
Nkumbi, had been treated for her injuries in hospital and would
press charges. Prosecutors were considering a charge of attempted murder
but were still studying the facts, an official from the
prosecutors office told Reuters. A video purporting to show Nkumbi falling head first down a
steep flight of stairs has appeared on social media.   Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky would contact the guests
involved, the company said in a statement sent to Reuters. "Appalling and unconscionable behaviour against members of
our community runs counter to everything Airbnb stands for,"
David King, an Airbnb official, said. "We will take the strongest actions we can against such
abhorrent conduct, including banning people for life from our
platform and assisting law enforcement with their investigation
and potential prosecution. Nobody should ever be treated like
this and it will not be tolerated.‚Äù Airbnb is hugely popular in The Netherlands, attracting 1.4
million guests to the country in 2016. Reuters
