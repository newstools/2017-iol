Wolverhampton, West Midlands - Jaguar has pushed the performance envelope of its Ingenium range of turbopetrol fours again, with the announcement of the P300, which gets its name from from its horsepower rating - equivalent to 221kW. Itâ€™s a further development of the 184kW P250 version announced earlier this year, using the same twin-scroll turbo with ceramic ball bearings, close-coupled mountings and high-flow compressor wheel. The new engine is available to order in the XE and XF sedans, and the F-Pace SUV, in each case driving the rear wheels via an eight-speed ZF transmission, although Jaguar Land Rover SA has yet to mention anything so mundane as prices. What it does quote, however, is a peak torque figure of 400Nm, enough to launch any of the three models off the line to 100km/h in six seconds or less. Nominal fuel consumption on the NEDC test bench is quoted at 6.7 litres per 100km for the XE, 6.8 for the XF and 7.7 litres per 100km for the much bigger-bodied F-Pace. Mod Cons Included in the latest update are convenience features such as hands-free boot lid opening for the XE and XF, and an additional drive mode that allows you to tune the gear-shift, throttle response and steering weighting to your personal preference.
