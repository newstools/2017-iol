Van Breda, who was granted R100 000 bail in June, was smartly dressed and flanked by his legal representatives. He hurried out of court after the hearing. Van Breda faces three counts of murder, attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice. The state alleges that in January 2015, Van Breda hacked to death his father Martin, mother Teresa and brother Rudi. It also alleges that he attempted to kill his sister Marli and that he falsified information he gave to the police. Weekend Argus
