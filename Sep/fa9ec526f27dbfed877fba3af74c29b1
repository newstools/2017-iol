MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Sihle Zikalala, will also host a series of event to promote the province as a tourist attraction. Next week, he will host the Lilizela Tourism Awards at the Umfolozi Casino and Hotel, where he will be recognising and awarding KZN tourism players who continue to deliver excellent service to tourists. The official Tourism Month celebrations will be held in the Amajuba District Municipality on September 15. . He said it was important that everyone sees the important role that they also play in tourism, beyond those who are directly employed in the sector. . “This month we encourage people of KZN to travel, explore and enjoy their province.
“When tourists come to KZN, it is not only the people that are on the frontline of the sector, such as tourist guides and tour operators, who ensure that tourists have a memorable holiday. It is also ordinary citizens who assist them with directions, who work at restaurants, taxi drivers and street vendors that make this province known the world over for its warmth and hospitality," Zikalala said. He said great experiences at a hotel, a restaurant, or a theme park become entrenched in the memories of visitors and the same reason why they would return.
