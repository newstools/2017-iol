The 33-year-old reality TV star has admitted to being addicted to love-making during a candid conversation with Kris Jenner, Khloe Kardashian, Kim Kardashian and his ex.  Speaking on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians', Scott confessed: "I'm a sex addict. I'm a f***ed up, horrible sex addict."

Kourtney, 38, confronted Scott about the decision, calling his behaviour "disrespectful". She said: "On a family vacation, don't you think it's inappropriate and disrespectful? "To me, to your kids and to all my family? There's a level of respect and appropriateness that should just be known, but apparently, it's not."

She explained: "You had your chance. I thought we were spending our whole lives together, and I've done everything I can." Scott's claims of being a sex addict prompted a similar reaction from Khloe, who slammed the party-loving star before she poured a glass of water over his head.

Meanwhile, Kourtney subsequently admitted she needed to tell Scott that there was no chance of them ever rekindling their romance. She shared: "Scott's so lucky, because I am the coolest baby mama on the planet. The stuff that he's done and I still allow him to come on our family trips? "I just feel like I need to have a conversation with him just to finally say we will never be back together. It's probably better for both of us."
