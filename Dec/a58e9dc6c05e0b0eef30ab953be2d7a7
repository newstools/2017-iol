CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works has proposed to replace the 'CA' with 'CAA' on license plate. The department has called on the public to comment on the proposals for the changes. It is believed that the change will apply to all new vehicle registrations, therefore current vehicle owners or people who wish to transfer the vehicle license to a different vehicle will not be affected. The changes are being introduced because licensing authorities are running out of possible alphanumeric combinations which will inevitably lead to duplicates.
