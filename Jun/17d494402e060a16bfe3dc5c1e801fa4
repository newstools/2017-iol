CAPE TOWN: He’s toiled away for many a year, and now his big moment is on the horizon. Heino Kuhn is sure to open the batting for the Proteas alongside Dean Elgar in next Thursday’s first Test against England at Lord’s, and says “rather late than never” about his imminent debut in the five-day arena. The 33-year-old Titans right-hander is in top form, having hit a double hundred and another century for South Africa A on their just-completed series against the England Lions. Kuhn will get another opportunity to fine-tune his game this Thursday for the Proteas when they take on the Lions in a warm-up game at New Road in Worcester, and feels that he is well prepared for his Test bow. “I have matured a lot over the years as a batter and as a cricketer. I believe everything happens for a reason, and maybe five years ago wasn’t my time. I’m happy to be here and I’m looking forward to this challenge,” Kuhn said in a Cricket South Africa statement on Tuesday. “I’m going to try and approach it like I do with every game. I know there is going to be a bit more pressure, especially if I make my debut, but it will be important to see it like it’s any other game. “Opening the batting everywhere is quite tough, but it is a lot more challenging in South Africa and England. My job is to take the newness off the ball. I’ll have to try and leave as well as I can, know where my off-stump is and take it from there.” Proteas Test Squad
