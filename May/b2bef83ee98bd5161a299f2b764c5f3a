The Financial Services Board (FSB) has warned the public about two companies that purport to be registered credit rating agencies. It has been brought to the attention of the registrar of credit rating agencies at the FSB that two entities, called Crown Finance and Crowd Funding, are advertising that they are registered credit rating agencies and are contacting people with the aim of offering financial services. The FSB warns against doing financial services business with these companies. They are not registered credit rating agencies and are not authorised financial services providers. The FSB reminds you that, before doing business with an entity offering financial services, you should check, either by telephoning the FSBâ€™s toll-free number (0800 110 443) or by visiting its website (www.fsb.co.za), whether or not the entity is authorised to render financial services, and if it is, which financial products it is permitted to offer.
