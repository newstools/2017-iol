Stuttgart - Mercedes-AMG is getting ready to unleash its most brutal road car ever. The Project One is set to be shown off in “near series” form at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September and the production version that’s set to follow is being touted as the first ever road car to feature “genuine Formula 1 hybrid technology”, according to Mercedes-AMG. Most details are still under wraps, but the company has announced that the petrol-electric drivetrain will produce a combined output of more than 1000 horsepower (or 735kW in metric speak). The petrol-powered component of the hybrid system is expected to retain the 1.6-litre V6 format of Merc’s 2017 Formula One car.
Yet whereas the F1 car is rear-wheel driven, the Project One hypercar will reportedly have an all-wheel-drive set-up in which the front wheels can be individually driven by electric motors. “The hypercar is a true performance hybrid that marks the pinnacle of what is currently technologically feasible,” Mercedes-AMG says. “It is a project that sets a spectacular milestone on the way to the future of Mercedes-AMG.” On a more sober note, Mercedes-Benz will also use the Frankfurt show to unveil a concept car that shows off the company’s solutions for “shared urban mobility” and another one that potentially previews an upcoming compact electric car.
