JOHANNESBURG - A proud Simphiwe Dludlu has issued a hard-to-refuse invitation to football fans: "come to Dobsonville Stadium and you will not be disappointed". The women’s national Under-17 team host Botswana at 3pm on Saturday, with a 5-2 lead from the first leg in the second round of the Under-17 World Cup qualifiers. Bantwana thumped Botswana in their first competitive match as a unit in what was a first taste of international football for a number of players. If they can win 5-2 on the road without much practice, imagine what they can do in front of their home crowd with a lot of confidence. “The South Africans who didn’t see the 5-2 win in the first leg missed out big time,” Dludlu said. “They missed out on seeing young girls who are passionate about playing football. They missed out on coaches who are enthusiastic and ready to plough back. "They must bring their picnic baskets and come through to support the girls at Dobsonville. Don’t waste the day sitting at home. Come and enjoy with us. It will mean a lot for the girls to play in front of their home crowd because in Botswana, the two goals they scored was because their own fans pushed them. We need our crowd to be there. "They must brace themselves for good football. We proved that we are capable of playing as a team in the first leg away. We were innovative and disciplined in our structures. Make a date with us and we will give you great football.” Bantwana will be buoyed not only by the 5-2 lead but also by the fact that eight of their players took part in the Sasol League National Championships last week. A win for Bantwana will see them advance to the last round of the qualifiers to face Morocco with a place in the World Cup up for grabs. The Star   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
