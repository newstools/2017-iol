  Landsberg, Germany – This just has to be the most sinfully self-indulgent video you’re going to watch this year, as technicians from the crash test centre of the German ADAC motoring association slam a 1:18 scale Lego model of a Porsche 911 GT3 RS into a steel plate at the standard 64km/h. The resulting disintegration is filmed in extreme slow-motion from a dozen different angles, just like a real crash test, and set to the perfect piece of music for the surreal visuals. This is not just any model, it's the latest in the Lego Technic series: It costs €300 (R4355), it’s 570mm long, contains 2704 parts and has an adjustable rear spoiler, adjustable, working head and tail-lights, working suspension with red springs, working gearbox, working steering wheel with gearshift paddles, detailed seating, opening doors, opening front boot with a suitcase inside, a glove compartment lid that opens to reveal the model’s serial number, and an opening rear lid to reveal a detailed flat-six boxer engine with moving pistons. And it doesn’t matter that it comes apart almost in its component parts - it’s Lego, you can just clip it back together again. So brew a fresh cup of coffee, relax and waste the next three minutes and 15 seconds of your day giggling insanely; go on, you know you want to.
