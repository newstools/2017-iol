Ford issued a safety recall notice on Monday, in which it said Kuga models equipped with the 1.6-litre engine had an engine overheating condition that could cause a fire. “A total of 4556 vehicles are affected by this safety recall in South Africa, and were built between December 2012 and February 2014. "Ford Kuga models with 1.5-litre and 2.0-litre engines are not affected,” said Ford SA spokesperson Minesh Bhagaloo. He said that since the recall, its national dealer network had provided about 3000 Kuga 1.6 owners with courtesy vehicles while the recall repairs were completed. “With this safety action and proper maintenance of the engine coolant system, including using the approved coolant at the required concentration level, the vehicles are safe to drive,” said Bhagaloo.
