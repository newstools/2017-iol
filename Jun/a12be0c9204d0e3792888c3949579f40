Cape Town - A Paarl landscaping team have bagged the prestigious Best Environmental Landscape Work award at the annual South African Landscaping Institute (Sali) Awards of Excellence. DDS Projects owner Danie Steenkamp and his team walked away with six awards in various categories at a lavish event held at the Leopard Creek Golf Club. Steenkamp said their award was for an almost one-hectare project for a veld garden established in Robertson. He said their project consisted of blending the landscaping into the natural environment surrounding the private residence, using species naturally found in the endemic renosterveld. “It is especially important for us to be recognised for ecologically friendly work that also carries a strong indigenous and water-wise component. The Sali Awards are considered to be the pinnacle in our industry and we are delighted to have so many projects acknowledged, ” said Steenkamp. The awards aim to encourage emerging trends by the redevelopment of existing landscapes towards more sustainable approaches. DDS was nominated in various categories with each award receiving a category ranking as well as a Water Wise ranking, except in Specialised Landscape Construction. Steenkamp said that water-wise landscaping is the way forward and added that he appreciated the recognition in this category immensely. The awards judging panel found that DDS Projects had managed to achieve the goal of the client, which was to rehabilitate the surrounding veld into the garden. Cape Times
