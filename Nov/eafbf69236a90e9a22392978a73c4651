South Africans have been urged to vote for local beauty Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters in the 2017 Miss Universe pageant being staged in the US at the weekend. The competition takes place at The Axis in Las Vegas on Sunday. Two queens. Two flowers. Our @demileighnp and the gorgeous @irismittenaeremf snapped back stage at the @missuniverse National Costume extravaganza. #DemiForMissUniverse #missuniverse #southafrica A post shared by Miss South Africa (@official_misssa) on Nov 18, 2017 at 11:52pm PST There are two ways to vote online. South Africans can either go to: Vote.MissUniverse.com or on Twitter at: #MissUniverse #SouthAfrica (retweets count). Her sponsors said voters can pre-vote 10 times per day until Saturday. There will also be a vote, during the live broadcast, for each round of the competition. We are so excited for you, @demileighnp! The whole country is behind you, bring that @missuniverse crown home. #DemiForMissUniverse #RoadToMissUniverse A post shared by Miss South Africa (@official_misssa) on Nov 9, 2017 at 8:14am PST The pageant will be screened live on Vuzu (DStv Channel 116) from 5am (SA time) on Monday.

I was fortunate enough to be chosen to visit the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. I got to bear witness to all the wonderful work they do in helping people with brain diseases. They are also the beneficiary of the funds raised from our national gift auction. This hit so close to home as my little sister was born without a cerebellum, which left her completely disabled and depended for survival. This visit reminded me of my promise to always be present, live in the moment and to enjoy every single moment twice as much, for the both of us. ‚ù§‚ù§ Outfit by @forevernew_sa A post shared by Miss South Africa 2017 (@demileighnp) on Nov 15, 2017 at 11:47pm PST No. it's not winter in the US at allüôàüòÇ Credits to @benjaminaskinas @yamamayofficial @boldsunlesstans @missuniverse @phvegas A post shared by Miss South Africa 2017 (@demileighnp) on Nov 18, 2017 at 8:19am PST What an incredible honor it is to be part of 93 phenomenal woman from all over the world.
