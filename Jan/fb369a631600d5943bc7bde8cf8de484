Montreal - At least five people were shot dead by gunmen during evening prayers at a mosque in Quebec City in Canada's French-speaking province of Quebec on Sunday, said Mohamed Yangui, the president of mosque.&quot;This is deplorable,&quot; Mohamed Yangui told dpa on the phone. &quot;I just got a call from the morgue asking me whether I could come in to identify five bodies.&quot;Quebec City police confirmed the shooting but were yet to confirm the number of fatalities. An unknown number of people were also feared injured in the shooting in the Sainte-Foy neighbourhood.According to local broadcaster Radio Canada, one suspect was arrested, while another was still being pursued by police.The reason for the attack is not yet known.Yangui said mosque administrators had not been able to get in. There was a large police perimeter around the Islamic Cultural Centre, he said.&quot;These people go to their prayers peacefully every day but now some of them will never come back home from their prayers,&quot; Yangui said in French. &quot;I'm shocked, I don't have words to describe how I'm feeling.&quot;Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard&nbsp;tweeted that the province was mobilizing to assure the safety of Quebec City residents.&quot;Quebec categorically reject this barbaric violence,&quot; Couillard wrote. &quot;We offer our solidarity to the loved ones&nbsp;of the victims and the injured and their families.&quot;The same mosque was targeted last June when someone left a pig's head on its doorstep.&nbsp; dpa
