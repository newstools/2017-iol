Baroka FC ended their seven-game winless streak by beating SuperSport United 3-1 in an Absa Premiership match at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Sunday afternoon. Former log-leaders Baroka opened the scoring on the half-hour mark. A cross from the left found former SA youth international attacker Lucky Nguzana, who drew United goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse before thumping the ball home with his left foot. A rejuvenated United side found the equaliser in the 53rd minute when their Nigerian central defender Azubuike Egwuekwe headed home from a corner taken by Thuso Phala. Baroka grabbed the winner in the 71st minute when midfielder Letladi Madubanya got on to the end of a free kick set-piece, beating goalkeeper Pieterse to the ball, with his header ending up in the back of the net. With SuperSport pushing forward as they chased the equaliser, Baroka found space on the left, with Talent Chawapiwaâ€™s blistering pace ending with a quality cross which Mduduzi Mdantsane converted in the 92nd minute. United would have kicked themselves all the way back to the change-room at the break, after missing two good chances earlier on. Phala should have headed home in the 37th minute after the ball beat two Baroka defenders and bounced towards him, but the winger headed his chance over the crossbar. In injury time at the end of the first period, United striker Bradley Grobler watched his shot hit the Baroka woodwork and go out of play from close range. Baroka, now on 22 points from 15 games, move to third on the league table and will play their next match on January 6 when they host Orlando Pirates. SuperSport, who remain on 15 points from 10 games, will play their final league match of 2017 against Bloemfontein Celtic in the Free State capital on Wednesday. African News Agency (ANA)
