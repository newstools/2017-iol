Yaounde â€“ A twin suicide bombing Friday killed nine people and the attackers in northern Cameroon, an official said. The attack in Kolofata near the Nigerian border left 30 people injured. Two suicide bombers detonated their explosives near a camp of Nigerian refugees in the morning, said the governor of the Far North region, Midjiyawa Bakary. "The refugees were praying and the attackers came pretending to be asking for food. No one suspected anything, since this is the Muslim month of fasting and Muslims are supposed to be generous," Bakary said by telephone. "The attackers detonated their bombs once they were among the praying Muslims," he added. The official attributed the attack to the Nigeria-based group Boko Haram. Since 2009, at least 14,000 people have died at the hands of the Sunni fundamentalists in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger. DPA
