Johannesburg - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday said it was of the firm view that MP Makhosi Khoza "has now crossed the line and must immediately face the consequences of her actions". Speaking at an event hosted by the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and Save South Africa on Nelson Mandela Day, Khoza reiterated her call for President Jacob Zuma to step down. The outspoken MP, who has received death threats, said she found it intolerable being led by a man accused of harassing women. Reacting to the comments the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal said it was "of the firm view that Cde Makhosi Khoza has now crossed the line and must immediately face the consequences of her actions"'. In a statement issued by provincial party spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli the ANC said: "Cde Makhosi is a member of the ANC and a deployed MP who is not immune from the political discipline of the ANC. Her public stunt and participation in platform intended to replace the societal leadership role of the ANC constitutes a blatant betrayal of the core values of the ANC". The ANC said Khoza's latest public pronouncements represented the "worst form of arrogance" which is completely at variance with the conduct expected from those representing the ANC. "Accordingly, the Provincial Working Committee has directed the ANC provincial officials to urgently and immediately institute disciplinary measures against Cde Khoza. She is now treating the ANC with absolute disdain and acts with a maximum degree of impunity." Meanwhile the party said it was "deeply humbled" and salutes volunteers and supporters of the ANC for what it said was a resounding success of the Nelson Mandela Day commemorations in the province.
