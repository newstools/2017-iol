There are thousands of tips on how to impress in interviews, from what to wear to how to act. But the best advice to bag a job is... to be yourself – including not trying to hide what you are bad at, according to a study. After analysing interviews among teachers and lawyers, psychologists from University College London found honest people are up to three times more likely to get their dream job when up against other high-ranking applicants. These people don’t avoid questions to cover up weaknesses and are unafraid to show their true personality. It pays off because employers use interviews to figure out if people are exaggerating their abilities. However, writing in the Journal of Applied Psychology, the authors warned the tactic only pays off for those who are well-qualified. For poorer candidates, honest answers may simply "bolster interviewers’ misgivings". Daily Mail
