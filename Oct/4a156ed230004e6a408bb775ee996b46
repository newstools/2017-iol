Bradley Grobler was the two-goal hero as SuperSport United reached the Caf Confederation Cup final with a 4-2 aggregate victory over Club Africain in Tunisia on Sunday night. Matsatsantsa a Pitori went into the second leg semi-final with a tough task after the first leg ended 1-1 at home two weeks ago, which meant that they had to score at least once to have any chance of going through to their first continental final. But Eric Tinkler’s men didn’t disappoint on the night at the Rades Olympic Stadium. Bafana Bafana striker Grobler put his team ahead with an unbelievable header from the edge of the box in the 16th minute. Right winger Thuso Phala delivered the perfect swinging cross that evaded the Club Africain defence, and Grobler connected to leave the home goalkeeper stranded. The newly-crowned MTN8 champions held on to the lead until break, and soon after halftime, star striker Jeremy Brockie doubled the advantage with a fine finish, following a classy through-ball from youngster Teboho Mokoena.   At 2-0 up in the second leg and 3-1 ahead on aggregate, SuperSport fans would’ve been forgiven if they had started celebrating. But in the 54th minute, defender Morgan Gould brought down Saber Khalifa in the box, and Khalifa got up to beat Ronwen Williams from the spot to pull one back for Club Africain. In the 65th minute, though, Grobler settled the outcome when he latched on another assist from Phala to hand United a 3-1 lead, which they never relinquished. SuperSport will face TP Mazembe from the DRC in the final, with the first leg set to take place on the weekend of November 17-19 away, and the return leg in South Africa on November 24-26. @ashfakmohamed  IOL Sport Like IOL Sport on Facebook
