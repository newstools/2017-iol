After a day of sightseeing and exploring all the hidden gems in Johannesburg, its always a good idea for a spa break. Starting this Friday, September 15, the spa at Four Seasons The Westcliff will offer three new night retreat packages aimed at rejuvenation and relaxation until 11pm. The ultimate luxury starts from R4 700. For a night spa package, guests get two 90 minute spa treatments, followed by bubbly and canapés served at Apres spa, the city's only outdoor rooftop lounge or choose a Westcliff Deli “chic-nic” (chic picnic) take-away to enjoy in the comfort of your home.
