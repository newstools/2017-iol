Kim Kardashian West made $10 million in one day from sales of her new perfume collection. The 37-year-old star's KKW Fragrance line, which consists of three scents, Crystal Gardenia, Crystal Gardenia Oud and Crystal Gardenia Citrus, were snapped up by fans of the reality TV beauty after going on sale online on Wednesday, November 15. According to TMZ, 300,000 bottles were produced and the whole lot are expected to sell out by today, November 16, which will increase sales to
$14 million. Kim launched a big social media campaign to promote her new perfumes and even set up a new Twitter account, KKW Fragrance, but that has only attracted just over 1,500 followers at the time of writing. But on the opening sales day #KKWFragrance started trending on Twitter and Kim's momager Kris Jenner also encouraged her fans to splash out
on her daughter's new beauty line. She tweeted: "I'm obsessseedd!! Kim's new fragrances just launched on KKWFragrance .How beautiful is this packaging and the scents are to die for!!

"I was sitting there and I‚Äôd get these collections of them and I started to really dig deeper into what they meant and the meanings behind them and started to go to these crystal warehouses in Culver City and downtown [LA]."
