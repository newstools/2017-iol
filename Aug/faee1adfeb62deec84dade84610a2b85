Kevin Lovell will end his role as CEO of the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) with effect from 17 August this year. The Board of SAPA has appointed Dr Charlotte Nkuna as Acting CEO for the next while.
 Lovell said in a statement, "At the request of the Board I will continue to assist the organisation for a limited period on matters requiring my attention. In its 113 years of existence, SAPA has provided services to the poultry industry. These activities continue to be very relevant to current conditions in the industry, including trade matters such as dumping and cheap imports, diseases like the recent H5N8 avian influenza outbreak, the drought and its effect on the poultry industry, as well as market demand issues of concern to producers and consumers."
 He concluded, "I would like to thank you all for the opportunity I was given to work in this industry and to interact with you as members, media and stakeholders. It was an honour to serve you all." - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
