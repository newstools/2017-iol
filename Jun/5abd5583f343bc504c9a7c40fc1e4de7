Thanda Safari, the 5-star private game reserve located in KwaZulu-Natal, and a member of The Leading Hotels of the World, has unveiled its latest offering. Otherwise referred to as The Green Mamba 1, it is a new Land Rover Defender remodelled into a luxurious game-viewing vehicle to provide guests with an even more exceptional photographic safari experience. Exclusive to Thanda Safari guests, the vehicle can be requested for private photography game drives lead by Christian Sperka, the Resident Wildlife Photographer and Field Guide who designed the vehicle himself. The vehicle has many remarkable features for the passionate photographer. These include seating for two photographers with extra legroom allowing them greater movement and access to shoot from different angles, a canvas floor matting for the photographer to kneel or sit on to shoot at eye level over the side of the vehicle, photography 'arms' on the back seats to rest beanbags or gimbals on as well as extra storage space for equipment. There is also seating for an additional three accompanying guests. Adding to the above, with guest comfort at the forefront and ensuring every need has been considered, an on-board Nespresso coffee machine has also been incorporated into the vehicle design along with Christianâ€™s signature Martini bush bar for evening drinks. Furthermore, a Marine Sound System comprising bird call recordings, a 12.9" Apple iPad Pro with the latest nature apps including Roberts Birds of Southern Africa and three sockets for spotlights - front-middle-back - have all been installed.
