CAPE TOWN – It won’t be a particularly pleasant Christmas for Allister Coetzee – and Springbok fans, for that matter. After recording just 11 wins in 25 Tests during his tenure, it was expected that Coetzee would be sent a “Don’t Come Monday” by SA Rugby chief executive Jurie Roux following the end-of-year tour to Europe, especially with returning director of rugby Rassie Erasmus back at the Plattekloof headquarters. But now Bok fans and the coaching staff have an agonising wait until January for the final word on the situation after they began their review of Coetzee on Wednesday. SA Rugby said in a press release on Friday morning that “in light of considerable speculation, please be advised that SA Rugby will not be in a position to respond to questions regarding that speculation on the coaching of the national team until the New Year. “A number of meetings and reviews are in progress on all national teams, after which plans for all teams in 2018 will be confirmed.” It is believed that SA Rugby are dealing with any possible legal loopholes before they make the ultimate decision to fire Coetzee. Independent Media has been informed that Erasmus has been hard at work since returning from Munster in Ireland in creating a new Bok blueprint for 2018, as he will be in charge of the team. It is still unclear exactly who will be the support staff – with speculation around the likes of Deon Davids and Mzwandile Stick being part of the new regime – but of course his right-hand man will be Jacques Nienaber, who has travelled a long road with Erasmus from their days together at the Cheetahs. @ashfakmohamed IOL Sport   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
