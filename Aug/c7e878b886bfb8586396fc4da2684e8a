CAPE TOWN- Taking place at the International Cape Town Convention Centre (CTICC) on 24 August 2017, My Business Expo and Business StartUp Show, Africa’s business startup and growth showcase, will provide new trends, ideas, cutting-edge solutions and plenty of opportunities for any business owner or entrepreneur. The event is about starting a business and for those seasoned business owners on the lookout for new ideas, more opportunities and better solutions. With hundreds of interactive exhibits and world class sessions and seminars, the event will draw on leading business experts and specialists, and provide delegates with an opportunity to discuss every facet of doing business right; from start-up to growth and success. "This event presents an unmissable opportunity and that each facet of the event is an ideal platform to gain valuable, practical insights to grow, learn, connect and network. The objective of the event is to give aspiring entrepreneurs, new start-ups and seasoned business owners the knowledge and tools they need to get ahead and become tomorrow’s legendary entrepreneurs", says Mike Anderson, NSBC founder and CEO. “This is why small business matters and why events like My Business Expo and Business StartUp Show are so important for those serious about starting or growing their own business and the future of the South African economy and the future of job creation are inextricably dependent on small business,” says Anderson. “If we had to rely on the statistics alone, South Africa would not build a small business community at all, instead it would rely on multi-nationals to develop the economy. This is the polar opposite of what we need as a nation. We need to create our own wealth and entrepreneurship provides one of the main engines of growth in any healthy economy,” concludes Anderson. - BUSINESS REPORT
