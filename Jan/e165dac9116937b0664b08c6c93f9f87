Chief executive David Kneale said yesterday the Clicks chain performed well in the current constrained consumer environment, showing volume growth of 4.2 percent, well ahead of most retailers. It is most encouraging that we continued to experience buoyant trading in the weeks after Christmas, driven mainly by value promotions across all of our product categories, he said.Clicks increased same store sales by 9.6 percent, with selling price inflation of 5.4 percent.Kneale said customer behaviour continued to reflect a shift to shopping later in the festive season and Clicks experienced record trading days in the week leading up to Christmas.Total retail sales for the Clicks Group increased by 12.2 percent and by 8.5 percent in comparable stores, with selling price inflation averaging 5.3 percent.Total group turnover for the 20-week period grew by 8.6 percent to R10 billion.Read also: Clicks grows sales 13.6%UPD, the group s pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution business, increased turnover by 6.4 percent, ahead of selling price inflation of 4.3 percent for the period.Kneale said management was confident of Clicks maintaining its competitive market position through its value offer to customers and the continued expansion of the Clicks store and pharmacy footprint.
