Pearl Thusi celebrated her birthday with her fiance, family and friends. The Quantico actress turned 29 on May 13, but shared the snaps on social media over the weekend. The occasion was indeed a star-studded affair, with the likes of Thandiswa Mazwai, DJ Zinhle, Nzinga Qunta in attendance and, of course, Pearl Thusi’s daughter Thandolwethu. In a series of images, Thusi described the details of her special day. Or perhaps she also wanted to prove that she and her radio presenter fiance Robert Marawa are still going strong, despite the recent rumours that they are experiencing relationship problems. #OPW: Hit & run for 10yrs & only come back later!
