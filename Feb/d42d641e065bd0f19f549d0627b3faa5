But there actually is another online platform that is much more effective at getting couples together. It turns out that a lot of couples have met over Twitter – the hashtag #wemetontwitter started trending as people started sharing stories of how the microblogging site helped them find love. Most famously, one woman married the man she first fell for after loving his nerdy tweets from the official Waterstone’s bookshop Twitter account. “Well I’m in love with whoever is manning the @WstonesOxfordSt account. Be still my actual beating heart,” Victoria Carlin tweeted back in 2012. The two then tweeted each other back and forth for a little while before meeting. Carlin married Jonathan O’Brien last July.
