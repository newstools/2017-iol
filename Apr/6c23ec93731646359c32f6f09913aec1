These phyllo tarts look good and taste great and are ideal as a starter on your Easter menu. Serves 6. Ingredients: 400g spinach, roughly chopped 175g packet of sundried tomatoes, drained and chopped 80ml bottled artichoke hearts, about 4, drained and chopped 2 eggs 100g feta cheese, crumbled salt and pepper 6 sheets of phyllo pastry 100g butter, melted Method: Boil the spinach in salted water for a few minutes until wilted. Drain well, squeeze out any excess water and then chop finely. Tip into a large bowl and combine with the sundried tomatoes, artichokes, eggs and feta. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well. Carefully unroll the phyllo pastry. Take out 6 sheets of pastry. Place a sheet of pastry on the counter and brush liberally with the melted butter. Cut sheet into 4. Drape one quarter, butter-side up, in a 10-12cm loose-bottomed tin so that some of the pastry hangs over the side. Repeat twice more, leaving a quarter of the phyllo pastry. Spoon in some of the spinach filling. Pull the sides up into the middle, making sure the filling is covered. Brush with more melted butter. Scrunch up the last quarter of pastry and place in the middle of the tart. Brush with melted butter. Repeat with remaining pastry sheets and spinach filling. Bake in a preheated oven at 180Â°C for 15-20 minutes, until golden.
