The world is in a steamy love affair with compact SUVs and crossovers, and the motor industry seemingly can't build enough of these hatchbacks-on-stilts. Jaguar wants in on the action and joins the fray with its new E-Pace, clearly inspired by the success of its larger F-Pace SUV which helped boost the British brand's sales by 83 per cent last year. Jaguar has also announced an all-electric I-Pace will go into production in 2018. Due to make its world premier on July 13, the E-Pace is smaller than the F-Pace and will go up against the likes of the Audi Q5 and Porsche Macan in the premium crossover category. Details are sketchy but Jaguar says the vehicle will feature sports car-derived all-wheel drive technology and an all-Ingenium line-up of petrol and diesel engines, as well as a suite of connected technology and safety features. “The combination of sports car looks with Jaguar performance will ensure that the E-Pace stands out,” said Ian Callum, Director of Design, Jaguar. “Every Jaguar is designed to excite the senses, and we think E-Pace will do just that, albeit with its own individual character.” The teaser was accompanied by a close-up picture of the E-Pace's tail light and a red-washed side shot. We will provide more details as they emerge on July 13.  IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
