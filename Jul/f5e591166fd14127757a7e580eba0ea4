'Coloured President' explores the hilarious nature of the South African and world political arena, and of course, what South Africa would be like if it had a coloured president. This all while keeping it a clean, no-swearing, laugh-a-minute affair, suitable for the whole family. “This is my most daring and colourful show. There are lots of off-the-wall ideas, impersonations and everyday characters in some not-so-everyday situations,” comments Carvin about what audiences can expect from the show. The show reached success across South Africa, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, New Zealand and Australia and even a two-month run earlier this year, at the MSC Sinfonia's 700-seater San Carlo Theatre. “I performed 'Coloured President' across the country and overseas, and I can promise this will be one of the funniest one-man shows that Cape Town has seen,” he adds. Durban-based funny man, Carvin Goldstone is a multiple award-winning comic and journalist, and he eagerly awaits the 2017 Savanna Comics’ Choice Awards where he is nominated for three categories (Flying Solo Award, The Nando’s Best Friend of Comedy and Savanna Comic of the Year). Tickets for 'Coloured President' are available at R150 per person and can be booked through Computicket. The show starts at 8.15pm, at The Baxter Theatre Centre.
