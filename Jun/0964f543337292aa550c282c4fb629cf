 Sir David Attenborough has revealed his biggest regret in life is being away from his children and missing precious family moments. The broadcaster said although he has had a glittering career, it has meant being absent for milestones in the lives of his two children. In a Radio Times interview, the 91-year-old said he would sometimes be off filming for months at a time. He said: "If you have a child you miss three months of his or her life, it’s irreplaceable; you miss something. And I did. "Perhaps you can’t have your cake and eat it."  Daily Mail
