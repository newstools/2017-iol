Durban International Convention Centre is up for another World Travel Award for  Africa’s Leading Meetings and Conference Centre, but they need your help to win the award. They won the coveted award last year and it was their fifteenth in 16 years to hold the title. Marketing and sales manager Scott Langley said the team was thrilled when they found out that they had been nominated again. “There are a number of factors which set us apart from the competition. The Durban ICC was South Africa’s first International Convention Centre so we have the most experience in hosting international events and our team puts this expertise to good use with every event. “Secondly, we are the largest flat-floor, column-free event space on the continent, so we are able to host some of the largest events ever staged in Africa, as well as host numerous smaller events simultaneously within the Centre,”he said. In the past financial year, the Durban ICC successfully hosted 547 events, constituting a 38% growth on 2016’s figure of 397 events.  Some of the events they hosted included the World Economic Forum on Africa, the International Society of City and Regional Planners Congress (ISOCARP) and the 21st International AIDS Conference, the largest event of its kind ever hosted on the African continent, attracting 22,000 delegates to Durban. The Durban ICC was also recognised as one of the Top 15 Convention Centres in the World by the International Association of Congress Centres (AIPC), and was notably the only convention centre in Africa to have made the final list despite several entrants from the continent.
