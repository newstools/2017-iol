Oprah Winfrey, the powerhouse talk show host and media mogul is cruising Alaska. She is sharing her inspiring travel journey with her fans on social media. O, The Oprah Magazine Adventure of Your Life Cruises is a result of a partnership with Winfrey and Holland America Line to pair travel with the content found in every issue of the magazine. More than 300 Holland America Line cruises departing from North America, will feature special O-inspired activities that invite guests to open their minds, change their perspectives and uncover their potential. On one of the videos posted on Instagram this week, Winfrey greets some of her neighbours on the ship. We get a peek of the stunning mountains in the background. “Nice view,” she tells them as she watches the view of the calm ocean. This year is dubbed Oprah's Year of Adventure. We cannot wait to see where she heads to next.
