There is nothing more serene that waking up in a houseboat with views of the lagoon. What’s more, a houseboat is the perfect place to enjoy sundowners and late night dinners with only the ocean and your loved ones keeping you company. In Knysna, Houseboat Myrtle, situated 2 Waterfront Drive in the Garden Route, is a self-contained cottage on the water. Anchored in the Knysna Lagoon, it’s just a two minute dinghy ride away from the Knysna Waterfront. Myrtle is one of the original Knysna houseboats and has a wood finish. The deck offers stunning views of the lagoon, the quays and the Knysna Heads.  The houseboat sleeps four guests on two double beds. Fitted with a kitchen nook with a stove and fridge and a hot shower and toilet, this place is ideal for anyone who wants to escape. Julia Coates, the owner, said the houseboat was hand crafted. “It is more like a cottage in the water. The boat was made by a local crafter named Mark Susman around 30 years ago. He lived it for 8 years and those who bought it also lived on it. I stayed on it for 8 years until I started to rent it out 4 years ago. “It’s a unique stay when visiting Knysna. One can fish, swim and a there is fireplace on board to warm cold nights,” she said. Prices ranges from R1000 for two. There are many houseboat accommodation near the Langebaan area.
