 Caster Semenya married her long-time partner in an extravagant ‘white wedding’ ceremony on Saturday which coincided with her 26th birthday. The 800m Olympic gold medallist posted a string of photographs of the event in Pretoria on Instagram, in which she referred to her bride Violet Raseboya as ‘my heart’. Semenya’s victory at the Olympics in Rio last summer was the most bitterly contested event of the games - and she credited Violet, 30, and her home fans with providing the strength and confidence to confront her critics, or ‘haters’ as she called them.

The rules have since been challenged, which means Semenya can now compete without the medication, which provoked protest from her fellow competitors in Rio. British runner Lynsey Sharp experienced the wrath of the South African’s massive fanbase after she complained about the ‘ unfairness’ of having to compete against the faster woman.  My heart. #loveyou #ourweddingday #ourperfectday #married #casviowedding A photo posted by Mokgadi Mokgadi Mashishi (@castersemenya800m) on Jan 7, 2017 at 4:19am PST  Sharp finished sixth in the 800m final at Rio - despite achieving a personal best time - and has previously complained the South African’s- condition resulted in ‘two separate races’.
