Based on the Peugeot 3008, it’s due to make its world debut at the Frankfurt motor show in September, probably with the same choice of 1.6-litre turbopetrol, and 1.6-litre and two-litre turbodiesels as the 3008. At 4477mm long on a 2675mm wheelbase, 1844mm wide and 1636mm high, the Grandland X is about 200mm longer than the Mokka X and Crossland X, putting it squarely in the C segment for compact SUVs. Opel also quotes seating for five, and a 514 litre cargo bay that can expand to a maximum of 1652 litres with the rear seats folded. While no mention is made of possible all-wheel drive, it will have Opel’s electronic grip control, with five drive modes, adapting the torque distribution to the front wheels, allowing a little wheelspin when necessary, and adapting throttle response (as well as the shift points on automatic transmission models) to suit the road surface. Also standard will be adaptive LED headlights with cornering function, high beam assist and auto levelling, adaptive cruise control with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, driver drowsiness alert, park assist and a ‘smart’ tailgate that opens with a kick. Driver and front passenger are cosseted in Opel’s medically-approved ergonomic seats; all five seats are heatable, as is the steering wheel – which sounds silly until the first frosty morning of the Highveld winter. The instrument panel and switchgear are laid out horizontally, rather than vertically as on sports cars, with three rows of controls on the centre stack for infotainment, climate control and chassis functions. Connectivity is provided by Opel’s IntelliLink and OnStar, with inductive charging for smartphones. As soon as we have details on drivetrain specifications and a possible South African release, so will you.   IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
