CAPE TOWN - KPMG’s CEO Nhlamu Dlomu, was seen dodging serious and tough questions at Thursday’s briefing to Parliament’s standing committee on public accounts. The firm came under fire for failing to respond to multiple red flags while doing work for the Guptas over 14 years. The company was said to have audited 35 companies belonging to the Guptas. KPMG was also roasted for creating a crisis in the country with its SARS rogue unit report, which implicated former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. The unit was accused of conducting covert intelligence operations under "Project Sunday Evenings"‚ with its members allegedly spying on‚ among others‚ the National Prosecuting Authority. The report was partly instrumental in the downfall of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan‚ who was accused of knowing and endorsing the "rogue unit".
