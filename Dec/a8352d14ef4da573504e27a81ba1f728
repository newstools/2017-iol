Sausage makers have been accused of failing to cut unhealthy salt levels One lobby group says salt, which is linked to raised blood pressure and strokes, has become a "forgotten killer". Its research suggests that a sausage sandwich could contain nearly two-thirds of an adultâ€™s maximum 6g daily recommended intake - more than in a double cheeseburger and large chips. The study by Cash (Consensus Action on Salt and Health), found many premium and vegetarian sausages had high salt levels. Public Health England set voluntary salt reduction targets for sausages due to be met by the end of the year. But Cash found many brands failed to meet them. The PHE target is a maximum of 1.38g of salt per 100g in raw sausages. The Cash study, largely based on salt in a cooked sausage, found more than 50 products above that. Graham MacGregor, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Queen Mary University of London and Cash chairperson, said PHE must get tough on the companies not complying.
