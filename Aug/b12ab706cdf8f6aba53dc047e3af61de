 A NETFLIX show has been linked to a jump in Google searches about suicide. The drama 13 Reasons Why follows a 17-year-old girl who kills herself, after leaving cassette tapes explaining her decision. Writing in the British Medical Journal, Austrian Dr Thomas Niederkrotenthaler said that Google searches for suicide rose after it was released – a potential indication that more people were thinking about the act. He called for a crackdown on how suicide is shown on screen.  © Daily Mail
