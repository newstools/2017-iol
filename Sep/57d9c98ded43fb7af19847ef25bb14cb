DURBAN: Fastjet is the latest airline to launch direct flights to Mozambique after only operating between Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa for years. “Today’s announcement marks Fastjet’s first expansion since the implementation of our ‘Stabilisation Plan’ and will see the brand enter a market where sustained demand for both leisure and business travel presents a very positive business case,” said chief executive Nico Bezuidenhout. He said Fastjet would be the first low-cost carrier to enter the Mozambican market and Friday’s launch came as the airline positioned itself for growth. The plan is to initially serve some of the larger commercial centres in Mozambique with Embraer E145, a 50-seater aircraft. “All indicators point to robust demand for affordable air services in Mozambique, with the African Development Bank forecasting GDP growth of 5.5% for 2017 and 6.8% next year,“  said Bezuidenhout. “We are looking forward to entering the Mozambican market and providing access to more affordable air services under the Fastjet brand.” Fastjet’s schedule, network and on-sale date for flights in Mozambique will be announced soon.
