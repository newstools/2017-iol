Munich, Germany - It’s not even a new model, but the sheer in-your-face presence of the BMW i8 Protonic Frozen Black Edition will make it one of the stars of the BMW stand at the Geneva motor show in the first week of March. Mechanically unchanged from the standard version, it’s finished in a special paint mixed for this limited run of cars by BMW Individual, with grey metallic accents. The interior is trimmed in black leather with yellow contrast top-stitching across the seats and centre console, set off by a dark grey headliner, grey seat belts and ceramic trim elements. The Protonic Frozen Black i8 will be made available in very limited numbers from April 2017 and only 12 have been allocated to South Africa - so if you want one you’d better start asking now. Or, if you want a version of Munich’s magical sports hybrid that will really stand out from the crowd, later in 2017 BMW will be releasing the i8 Protonic Frozen Yellow Edition with the same interior, but with a model-specific yellow paint finish.
