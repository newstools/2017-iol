Kylie Jenner has dodged potential legal action over her beauty brand Kylie Cosmetics. The 19-year-old star – who launched her cosmetics company last year – has previously been accused of stealing make-up artist Vlada Haggerty's work by copying the liquid lip art showcased on the stylist's social media site in her own beauty campaigns and packaging, which sees lip products drip off a made-up mouth. According to TMZ, the beauty mogul has since backtracked and instead of offering a cash sum to resolve the issue, the television personality has started plugging Vlada's work on her Instagram account. Alongside an image of Vlada's styling of a woman with her fingers dusted in gold powder as they cover her eyes and draw attention to the glossy ombre lip gloss, which has been shared on Kylie's photo-sharing site, she wrote: "Check out this inspiring photograph from @juliakuzmenko and @vladamua! (sic)." This news comes after Vlada shared a comparison of her pictures and a Kylie Cosmetics advert last year, which saw her accuse the teen entrepreneur for copying her work and attempting to pass it off as her own, and threaten to sue her. Vlada's post read: "Really @kyliecosmetics? Haven't you gotten enough 'inspiration' from me already? Left is a the work @juliakuzmenko, @brittrafuson and I shot a few months ago and right is @kyliecosmetics new campaign. (sic)" However, that wasn't the first time Vlada has accused the brunette beauty of copying her ideas, as she slammed Kylie last year for stealing an image of lips dripping with gold. At the time, she said she was excited to see her work being showcased by the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star, but was upset she didn't receive a credit or even get any contact from the reality star or her team. She said: "Crediting artists is essential, but this goes beyond that. "It's theft; this is our livelihood... I see these things happen too many times to artists. Bang Showbiz
