  As is almost always the case with viral internet videos, we don’t know what sparked this full-on rallycross battle between two Indian bus drivers who seem hell bent on being first to the next stop. What we do know is the road in question – reportedly a section of Coimbatore-Pollachi highway in the southernmost Indian state of Tamil Nadu – is clearly occupied by a number of innocent road users. One oncoming tuk-tuk narrowly avoids a head-on collision at 1:48 in the video.   We’ve driven on the free-for-all road network in India before, and we know it’s a chaotic experience at the best of times… but this takes recklessness to a new level. Giniel de Villiers, watch your back. These two want your job!
