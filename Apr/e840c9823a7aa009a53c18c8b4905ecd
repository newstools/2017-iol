British Airways may introduce charges for meals on long-haul flights in economy class at the same time as cramming in more seats. The airline has already caused controversy by ditching free food on short-haul services in favour of sandwiches. And it seems that policy could be extended to economy seats on long-haul flights to the US, Caribbean and Far East. At the same time, the airline is adding an extra seat into each row on many flights in a further move towards becoming a no-frills' airline for people on a budget. But while economy passengers are offered packaged sandwiches and tighter seating, Club World travellers will enjoy a new culinary boutique experience'. For BA is pouring R6,8 Billion (£400million) into upgrading the luxury for customers who turn left when boarding its aircraft. Details of the changes were revealed by BA's boss, Alex Cruz, who claims that customers on short-haul flights have come to appreciate the menu changes after a rough start'. He argued the change, which came into effect in January had been a  perfect decision'. Cruz said: It's going great. Customers say to us: Finally, I have good choices. No more chicken or beef''.' Asked if the service could be extended to long-haul economy, he told the UK Sunday Times: "We might do it." Explaining the two levels of service Cruz says: "We need to focus on enhancing premium  offering contemporary service, improved catering and lounges and a consistent experience. "In economy, where we know that price is the driver, we need to focus our efforts on delivering more seats at the lowest fares and giving customers choices."
