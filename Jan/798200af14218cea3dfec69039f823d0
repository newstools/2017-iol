Durban - DVD’s supposedly showing the funeral of late gospel music star, Sfiso Ncwane, are selling like hotcakes on the streets of Durban. The DVD’s, which are clearly homemade, are covered in Ncwane’s pictures that circulated on social media shortly after his funeral was held at Moses Mabhida. One of the streets the DVD is sold on is Warwick at the Market in downtown Durban. Walking on the streets you can hear vendors or random people walking shouting “Sfiso Ncwane funeral DVD for R10”. People interviewed said that you can buy this DVD for R8 or R5 if you do not have R10.  On the cover of the DVD, there are some of the artists that performed at his funeral, his casket, and a picture of the Mayor of Durban mayor Zandile Gumede who is surrounded by pastors. Furthermore, to attract a wider audience, the person who put the DVD together inserted pictures of Babes Wodumo, Mampintsha and Rebecca Malope on its cover. When played, the DVD begins by showing it is a four-hour long recording and starts off with people entering Moses Mabhida Stadium. When contacted for comment, Ncwane Communications spokesperson, Asanda Mpaise, was shocked by this and revealed they were not aware of this. “It is painful and disappointing that some people would try to make money in the form of a difficult experience the Ncwane family went through,” she said. “Can people also please show respect by not buying the DVDs, and if they can, could they rather show us where they are being sold so we can report this,” Ncwane Communications made a request to be contacted on 031 301 2380 should anyone spot someone selling these DVDs.
