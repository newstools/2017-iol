Spoil mom on Sunday and make sure she knows you are grateful for everything she does for you by baking these delicious, healthy and easy to make muffins from Pouyoukas. Serve warm with a cup of tea or coffee in bed. Ingredients 200g nutty wheat flour 50g Pouyoukas whole rolled oats plus extra for sprinkling 2 large eggs 150ml plain fat-free yogurt 100g applesauce or puréed pie apples 1 ripe banana mashed 5 tbs (75 ml) honey 1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla essence 1½ tsp (7.5 ml) baking powder 1½ tsp (7.5 ml) bicarbonate of soda 1½ tsp (7.5 ml) cinnamon 2 tbs (30ml) Pouyoukas omega seed mix plus extra for sprinkling  Method Preheat oven to 180°C and spray a 12 hole muffin tin with non-stick spray. Combine yoghurt, apple sauce, mashed banana, honey and vanilla. In a separate bowl, combine all the remaining dry ingredients. Add the wet to dry ingredients and mix until smooth (do not over-mix as this will cause the muffins to be heavy). Spoon the mixture equally throughout the tin and sprinkle with extra oats and seeds. Bake for 25-30 minutes until well risen and golden and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove from oven and transfer to wire rack. Allow to cool.
