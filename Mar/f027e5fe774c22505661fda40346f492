Free State Stars striker, Mohammed Anas, earned the man of the match award after bagging a double in a PSL match against Ajax Cape Town at Athlone Stadium on Friday night. But the “player” quickly went from hero to zero during a hilarious post-match interview. After his heroics in the 2-2 draw, a blundering Anas first thanked God for his performance and then his wife - AND then his girlfriend. Speaking to SuperSport anchor Kamohelo Thabiso Mbatha while accepting his award, Anas says: “Thank you for this, I appreciate my fans. My wife and my girlfriend I mean my wife, sorry.”    He quickly realises his own mistake, and tries to make up for it by saying: “I love you so much." After that, the player is so embarrassed, he can’t really string two words together. Let’s hope his wife - or girlfriend or whatever - forgives the footballer for putting his foot in it. Meanwhile, the Stars player is a Twitter superstar, with amused users like Gary Al-Smith tweeting: “Mohammed Anas just gave the greatest MoTM speech of all time, thanking both wife and girlfriend.”             Daily Voice
