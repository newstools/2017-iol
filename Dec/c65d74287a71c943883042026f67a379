Simon Cowell has confessed he was "thrown in jail" after hijacking a bus with a "pretend gun" at the age of 12. The 58-year-old music mogul has confessed he was arrested when he "jokingly" hijacked a bus with his friends by holding a "pretend gun" up to a bus driver and demanding he drove them to Watford. Asked if it was true that he once hijacked a bus at the age of 12, he confessed on ITV's This Morning: "It was a joke, I thought. I put a gun to ... I shouldn't even be saying this ... it was a pretend gun and we said to the bus driver, 'Take us to Watford' and he literally did not stop. I was in Watford the other day with Rak-Su and I told them this story ... the last time I went to bloody Watford I was actually thrown in jail." Meanwhile, Simon recently suffered a fall at home and had admitted how he feared he had broken his neck when he fell. He said: "I was lying on my back thinking, 'I hope I haven't broken my neck.' But the NHS staff were the most amazing people I've ever met, genuinely. Fortunately it was all fine ... He [Eric] probably would have told me off, and I didn't want to worry him. He's only three. It does make you realise what's truly important in life." Simon says it was low blood pressure to blame for his fall and has vowed to change his lifestyle in order to make sure he is as fit as he can be so that he can be the best father to his son Eric. He said recently: "Sometimes we get a reminder that we're not invincible and this was certainly mine. It was a huge shock. They think I fainted because I had low blood pressure and so I have got to really take good care of myself to sort that out. After all I am a dad and have more responsibility than ever."
