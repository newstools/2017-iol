“Currently traveling the world as naked as possible” reads the Instagram bio of two nudist travellers named Nick and Lins from Naked Wanderings. The Belgian couple in their 30s have started travelling in a rather unconventional way that it has now taken the internet by storm. They holiday in the nude, covering their genitalia in some cleverly posed pictures. 
From  wearing only a Naked Wanderings banner in Greece to watching the sea at Otok Murter, Kroatien in the nude, their travels are aimed at promoting naturism or nudism, especially at places around the world that allow it.  
According to their website, Naked Wanderings, the pair said the idea started in the summer of 2016 while they visited a couple of naturist campings on a trip through France and Italy. “It occurred to us that many times we were the youngest visitors. Not that we have anything against age differences, but we started wondering ‘whether naturism something reserved for the “elder”?, ‘what is it that keeps young people away from naturism? Or ‘is it because it’s still some kind of a taboo?” they posted on their website. 
They are now on a journey across the globe to research and inform people about naturism. “Somewhere in 2010 or 2011 or so we discovered naturism and we were sold immediately. The liberation of taking off our clothes was extraordinary, it was pure freedom.
“Most of our free time (and a lot of our money) is spent on traveling, meeting new people, discovering new cultures and getting a broader view on what’s going on in this world.We can try to inform people about naturism and show them that it’s not something for creeps or perverts but that it’s actually a very cool fun to do,” the added. 
The pair will visit Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and America to investigate the nudist opportunities available.
