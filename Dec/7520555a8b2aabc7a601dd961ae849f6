Lexus has released a teaser image of its new LF-1 Limitless concept vehicle that's due to be revealed at the Detroit Motor Show in early January. Lexus describes it as a “flagship” crossover, but it’s not a big and boxy three-row SUV like the BMW X7 Concept. Instead the Lexus sports a sleek coupe-like roofline and just two rows of seats, and if it went into production the premium Japanese crossover would slot above the current RX, likely competing with the forthcoming Audi Q8. The LF-1 Limitless concept came to life in the company’s Calty design studio in Southern California, and Lexus reckons it will “redefine the boundaries of luxury”, while creating a new premium crossover genre. That’s as much as we've been told for now, so stay tuned around January 15 next year to find out more and to see the new concept in all its glory. IOL Motoring
