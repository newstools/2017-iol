The 19-year-old mogul â€“ who launched her beauty empire Kylie Cosmetics last year â€“ has revealed she has joined forces with the 36-year-old reality star on a new make-up collection titled KKW x Kylie. The siblings announced the news of their latest venture with a promotional video on social media, which captures them both having their make-up completed as they gaze into a mirror before they glance at one another and smile. COMING SOON @kyliecosmetics #KKW A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Apr 18, 2017 at 10:20am PDT  The teen entrepreneur captioned the clip, which was shared on her Instagram page: "COMING SOON @kyliecosmetics #KKW (sic)." The 'Selfish' author also shared the same footage on her photo-sharing site making sure she too kept details of the latest venture close to her chest. The fashion muse â€“ who has three-year-old daughter North and 16-month-old son Saint with her husband Kanye West â€“ wrote: "KKW x KYLIE COMING SOON (sic)." However, this is not the first time the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star has teamed up with one of her siblings on a project for her label, as last year Kylie joined forces with KhloÃ© Kardashian, 32, to launch a four-piece Lip Kit called The Koko Kollection.

Kris re-shared the same video on her Instagram page, which she captioned: "So proud of my girls!! This is going to be one amazing collaboration!! @kyliejenner @kyliecosmetics@kimkardashian #KKW #comingsoon#proudmama (sic)."
