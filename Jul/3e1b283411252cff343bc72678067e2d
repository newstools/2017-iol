In the second video, recorded nine minutes after the first theft, an average-height male, dressed in a grey check salaah top, black hooded top and white fez, is standing against the wall in his socks, eyeing a pair of grey Nikes. He walks over, forces his feet in the takkies, looks around and leaves the mosque like nothing happened. Lieutenant-Colonel André Traut confirmed the arrest. He says: “On Friday a 35-year-old man was arrested on a charge of theft and he is due to make a court appearance today in Cape Town Magistrates’ Court.” The Daily Voice visited the Moegammadiyah Masjid on Sunday and attempted to contact the sheikh of the mosque, but all calls went unanswered.
