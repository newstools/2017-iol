10th minute: Israel Folau try from scrum set move two switches with Folau charging from the inside to score untouched. Springbok defence left in sixes and sevens yet again. 38th minute: Folau pulls Dillyn Leydsâ€™ by the hair which fuels brawl between players. Moments later Boks lose lineout from five metres out and relieve sustained pressure on Wallabies on the cusp of the half-time interval. No sanction for Folau. 43rd minute: Jan Serfontein try gives the Springboks the lead for the first time in the game. Siya Kolisi runs on the right hand side of the field and went over Kurtley Beale before offloading to Leyds, who threw an inside pass which was collected by Serfontein. 49th minute: Courtnal Skosan try. Boks running at full tilt from a lineout from the halfway line and showing some variation in running lines and speed with which they recycled the ball. Regained the lead 24-20. 57th minute: Kurtley Beale try. Springboks inability to make offensive tackles made it easy for the Wallabies to get over the advantage line and with enough men sucked into the inside, the Wallabies threw the ball wide to Beale. Wallabies regained the lead 27-24 79th minute: Elton Jantjies missed a penalty kick which would have won the Springboks the game but they had to settle for their second draw of the season against Australia. @Vata_Ngobeni  Sunday Independent  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
