JOHANNESBURG – Lions centre Rohan Janse van Rensburg is set for a short-term stint with English Premiership club Sale Sharks. Van Rensburg will be heading to Sale on a three-month deal before returning to the Lions ahead of the 2018 Super Rugby season. It’s been a difficult year for the 23-year-old both personally and professionally, with Janse van Rensburg having lost his mother to cancer, while he was also one of the victims of a violent house robbery in April. He suffered a serious knee injury in Super Rugby, while missing out on Springbok selection. The powerful centre did make a return to action towards the end of Super Rugby, while featuring prominently for the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup, and remains a player that many pundits believe could be making a valuable contribution to the Springbok cause. Janse van Rensburg told SARugbymag.co.za that missing out on national selection was one of the factors that contributed to him looking at some different options. “I’m really excited (about joining Sale). I hadn’t really thought about going overseas because I’d hoped to make the Bok squad (for the end-of-year tour), but when I unfortunately wasn’t selected, I started to think about other options. “The opportunity to join Sale then came up, and I’m really grateful to the Lions for allowing me to head over for a bit.” The midfielder earned his first Test cap on last year’s end-of-year tour, and he reiterated that he remained as hungry as ever to earn a recall to the Bok squad. “I remain so passionate about playing for the Boks, and it’s difficult when you’re not there, and of course there’s emotion if you’re not selected. “But that’s what I’m going to continue working towards, while hopefully this time with Sale will allow me to refresh somewhat and come back in good shape and as a better overall player.” African News Agency (ANA)
