Pretoria - The State Theatre in Pretoria was buzzing with music lovers, city dwellers and visitors eager to watch the multi-award winning Afro-pop singer Sindile “Ringo” Madlingozi.Madlingozi closed off Heritage month with a bang during his "one night only" performance on Saturday at the State Theatre. Among the music lovers anxious to hear what Madlingozi has in store for them was Lucky Ngobeni and his friend David Thauge from Soshanguve. Ngobeni said he expected the performance to be similar to the one Madlingozi recorded back in 2003 at the State theatre which he released both the DVD and CD."Unfortunately I did attend the performance in that year but the DVD was so good that I did not want this performance to pass me by," Ngobeni said. But Ngobeni's friend Thauge said it had been a while since he had heard anything from Madlingozi and because of that he expected nothing but sparks. Madlingozi is a Cape Town-born singer, producer and songwriter who rose to fame when he and his band Peto won the Shell Road to Fame contest in 1986. Since then he scooped multiple awards for his album and the South African Music Awards. virgilatte.gwangwa@inl.co.za
