 London - Prince George’s birth led to an understandable surge in British parents naming their boys after the third in line to the throne. But they do things differently in America, where parents have taken inspiration from a Star Wars villain. Kylo soared 2 368 places to 901st in the US table of popular boys’ names last year following the release of The Force Awakens in 2015. Kylo is the grandson of Darth Vader in the film. For girls the name Kehlani surged 2 487 spots to 872nd after singer-songwriter Kehlani Parrish was nominated for a Grammy.  Daily Mail
