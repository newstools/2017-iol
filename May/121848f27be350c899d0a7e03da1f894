If I told you of all the reasons why I am deeply in love with the African Continent, this would be a conversation we’d have till the wee hours of the morning. This continent, the dark continent, the continent that lacks development is my first love. It’s all I have ever known. Even with my increasingly broadening horizons, I still actively choose to live and love the African continent.
