ITALY- A device and app called Twinkly gives you the ability to control your Christmas decorations from your phone.  The Twinkly app is connected to your smartphone camera and can make a map of the position of each LED on your tree.    The product consists of 3 components: 1. Every Twinkly LED contains three new generation RGB LEDs and a chip that’s able to connect with a single string to a controller. 2. A controller that has a 2GB of flash memory and a Wi-Fi module, making it possible to control the light from any connected device through the app. 3. The system that makes the smartphone camera understand where the lights are placed: this way anyone can control each of them, one by one. The product can only be purchased online through Amazon for 99$ (R1 360.60), which in all honesty is a lot of money for Christmas lights. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
