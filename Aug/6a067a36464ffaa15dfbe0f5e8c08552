A British banker named Samuel Jankowsky boarded a flight that was set for London, only to realise later that Las Vegas was the destination. According to Daily Mail, he claimed that the airline staff checked his boarding pass three times. The 29 year old was supposed to be flying to Stansted after meetings in Cologne, Germany. It was only after an hour-long nap he woke up and spotted the Eurowings aircraft had flown past the UK on the journey-tracker on the entertainment system. He frantically Whatsapped his pregnant wife, Monique, using the on-board wifi before he landed 8,500 miles away in Las Vegas on June 30. Pictures posted by Jankowsky reveal that his boarding pass showed that Stansted as his destination. Daily Mail reported that Jankowsky claimed he was treated as a ‘common criminal” by US immigration officials who threatened to detain him for not having a visa. He eventually flew back to Cologne - but claims he was banned by Eurowings so had to travel to Stuttgart airport for a flight home. Sam was quoted saying:  “ When I got on the plane I did think it was a big plane for a short flight, but I didn't worry about it. “I put on my headphones and went to sleep. When I woke up I saw that we had passed the UK. I asked the person next to me what was going on and he said: "We're flying to Vegas". 'I said: "Oh f***! Can we turn the plane around?" I didn't even know Eurowings flew to Las Vegas,” he added. He said the whole experience not only cost him time but also 878.66 euros out of pocket for the food, hotel and flight home. Daily Mail
