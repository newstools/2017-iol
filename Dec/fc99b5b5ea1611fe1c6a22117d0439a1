The first annual South African DJ Awards which was scheduled to take place on December 23, at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, has been postponed to a date yet to be announced. In a press statement released on Wednesday, the awards organisers confirmed that due to unavailability of most the nominees, the event had to be moved to a new date. Due to the final  RSVP’s received from SADJ Awards nominees, it is of great regret to announce that the 1st Annual South African DJ Awards will be postponed to 2018 (date to be confirmed). This decision has been a result of low RSVP’s by our nominees, due to the fact that its the festive season and majority of them either have commitments or are booked all around South Africa or even abroad. How can such a prestigious event be hosted  at the absence  of  the awardees. This is not the purpose and objective of any award ceremony. Voting lines for the nominees are closed today, and all leading votes will still remain as the deciding factor of winners in each category. With the awards being postponed to 2018, no voting lines will be opened for the new proposed date. All winners are to be determined on the current existing votes, as fair competition. We hope with working together with all nominees that the date to be proposed will be a date where all our nominees will be present to embrace their fans and celebrate their artistry as pioneers of South Africa. Please note all tickets sold thus far will be rightfully refunded to all purchasers, by Ticket Pro. No funds are to be allocated to SADJ Awards.
