The foundation's chairperson Njabulo Ndebele said the manifestation of crime, corruption, poverty and unemployment was the result of Zuma's government's failure at all levels. "No wonder this untenable situation has seen calls from across the land to the President to step down. We urge Zuma to listen to the voices of the people...and should he do that, it would be the second time he heeds the people's call, the first call was when he gave himself to the struggle against apartheid," Ndebele said. He added that if Zuma was of "a good conscience" he would stay put after resigning and "not flee the country". "If the President of the Republic is a democrat, he will listen to South Africans and act accordingly as they desire." The foundation also supported a commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture by the controversial Gupta family. Ndebele said South Africans should take responsibility for "re-imagining the future". "If the future is to belong to South Africans who respect the Constitution, then all of us need to work in support of our collective intention. It is for these reasons that the NMF is resolutely opposed to the onslaught on the Constitution and the weakening of democratic institutions. We support the urgent establishment of a commission of inquiry to expose state capture in all its forms...we urge South Africans to be vigilant against what can only be called a capturing of democracy itself." The foundation's CEO Sello Hatang said his organisation would continue raising issues affecting South Africans. "We will continue to double our efforts in that regard and we urge our citizens to continue as well and voice out their opinions n the current state of affairs." Also present at the briefing were some of the foundation's board of trustees such as Tokyo Sexwale, Mamphela Ramphele Nikiwe Bhikitsha and Irene Menell. African News Agency
