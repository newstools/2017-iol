Mariah Carey's former security boss has threatened to sue her for sexual harassment and branding him a white supremacist but the lawsuit is currently on hold as they are believed to be negotiating a settlement. A draft lawsuit prepared by Michael Anello's lawyer claimed his company worked for the 'Hero' singer from June 2015 to May 2017 but were not paid a balance of $221,329.51, and had also been promised an additional two years work, which would have been worth another $511,000. According to TMZ, the documents state Mariah "constantly humiliated" Michael and his colleague by referring to them as Nazis, skinheads, KKK members and white supremacists, and claimed she "wanted to be surrounded with black guys, not white people." And the draft suit claims the 47-year-old singer - who has six-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe with ex-husband Nick Cannon - committed "sexual acts with the intent that they be viewed by Anello." On one occasion, Michael claims that during a trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mariah asked him to help move some luggage in her room but when he got there she was wearing an open see-through negligee. He tried to leave but she insisted he completed the task, but he eventually got out and there was no physical contact between them. Representatives for the 'Fantasy' singer explained they have been in touch with Michael's lawyer earlier this week and agreed to pay certain invoices, but the security chief isn't satisfied with the amount. Her spokespeople had no information on the sexual harassment allegation. Meanwhile, Michael's lawyer has put the lawsuit on hold, which is believed to be because they are currently in settlement negotiation.
