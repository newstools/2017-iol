LONDON - Roger Federer reached his 50th Grand Slam quarter-final and 15th at Wimbledon on Monday with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win over Grigor Dimitrov. Seven-time Wimbledon champion Federer will face either Canada's Milos Raonic, the sixth seed, or German 10th seed Alexander Zverev for a place in the semi-finals. Raonic defeated Federer in the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2016. Federer, 35, is also the second oldest man to make the quarter-finals at Wimbledon behind Ken Rosewall who was 39 when he reached the last-eight in 1971. "I'm thrilled to be back in the quarters again," said Federer who took his record over Dimitrov to 6-0. "It's very special to be in a 15th quarter-final here." Meanwhile, Sam Querrey booked a shot at Andy Murray in the Wimbledon quarter-finals with a five-set victory over Kevin Anderson on Monday. The US 24th seed beat the unseeded South African 5-7, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, 6-7 (13/11), 6-3. After making it through the fourth round for the second straight year - equalling his best-ever Grand Slam performance - he faces world number one Murray, the defending champion, in Wednesday's last eight. Querrey famously dumped Novak Djokovic out of Wimbledon in the third round last year. AFP   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
