With holiday season fast-approaching, we caught up with the travel experts at SA Flair Travel to get some insight into some essentials for any check list of travel essentials you'll be putting together for the coming holiday break. Don’t forget your cell phone If travelling overseas, find out about the roaming charges that apply and think of buying a local SIM card when you reach your destination. Original passport/identification document Bring documentation that reflects the exact name as on your booking. If there’s an error on your passport, you need to book your travel (flights) with that error. International regulations are stricter so you will be denied entry into the country should your names on the passport not match your ticket and itinerary. Leave a copy of your itinerary Make sure your family knows where you’ll be and how to contact you while you’re away. Universal adapter Make sure you know the type of plug sockets the country you’re visiting uses, otherwise your gadgets will be useless. Emergency contact and insurance information Your medical aid card is usually your best bet! Medication Don’t go anywhere without pain-killers! It’s a good idea to carry a basic first aid kit as well. Dress comfortably It is always relaxing to wear loose clothes when travelling.

Mouthwash You do want to make an impression in that business meeting/new social circle right? They don’t need to know what you ate or drank last night!
