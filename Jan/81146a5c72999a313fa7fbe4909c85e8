Cape Town An autistic 10-year-old faces life on the streets if his mother cannot find a new home by the end of February. Noncedo Dubula, 33, is now desperately looking for a new home for her and her son Somila who was diagnosed with autism at the age of 3.Dubula s landlord Thandazwa Mlisana gave her until the end of February to vacate or risk having her one-roomed shack demolished.Due to her son s autism, he can t talk and is hyperactive and is yet to attend a school.Despite being on the housing database since 2005, unemployed Dubula is still waiting to receive a house of her own. Dubula said landlords had chased her out of their properties after a few months because Somila, because of his condition, breaks things and cries endlessly. To calm him, Dubula has to drug to give Somila to make him fall asleep. In this street alone I have lived in three houses and have been chased away because no one understands Somila s condition. People just can't live with him, she said. I went to the Social Development so many times and received no help. Social workers said I should give Somila away to them so that they can find a home for him, but I can t give my child away I love him so dearly, said Dubula.All she needs is a roof over her head.Cape Times
