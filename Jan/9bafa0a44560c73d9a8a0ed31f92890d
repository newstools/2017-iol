Johannesburg - Mining company Bauba said on Thursday that it had re-opened its wholly-owned chrome mine Moeijelijk after placing it under care and maintenance. It placed it into care and maintenance after the &shy;chrome- ore price dropped from&nbsp;$175 (R2380) a ton to $120 a ton in January last year, which made the company financially unviable.Bauba s chief executive, Nick van der Hoven, said that the rebounding chrome-ore price had prompted Bauba to resume its Moeijelijk mine.He said chrome-ore price had bounced back from a low of $80 a ton to $380 a ton. Van der Hoven said Moeijelijk was expected to produce 20 000 tons of chrome ore within three months, and expected chrome grade to be between 39 percent and 41 percent.
