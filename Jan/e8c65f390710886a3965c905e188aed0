The Afrikaans rapper has just unveiled Parow Brandy, and he is as thrilled as a kid on Christmas morning. Parow has been working behind the scenes over the last few months developing his own brandy and as from next week, Parow’s three-year-old Pot Still Brandy will be available at selected bars and restaurants. The rapper said his aim was to create a brandy that would be enjoyed by all South Africans. And apparently he had a tough time finding a company to work with, before deciding to venture out on his own. In a lengthy rant on Facebook, he slammed larney liquor makers for not having respect for low-income brandy lovers. “When ! was a lightie ! never could have imagined anyone would even like my tunes let alone me having my very own BRANNEWYN!” wrote Parow. “And now can finally drink a #REAL brandt, not these #brandy labels who told me they can’t work with me because their target market is a highest LSM than my fans...Basically saying my fans are not fancy or rich enough to drink their brandy, yet my fans are the people who drink the most of their fancy brandy, so now I have made a brandy for everyone, whether you live in a #shack or a mansion, drive a [Ford] Escort or a Porsche.” And according to him, Parow Brandy is the best on the market. “It’s a proper 3-year pot stilled brandy. And this I promise you, taste it, you will agree, its the next level.” Parow’s love for brandy goes all the way back to his high school years, he said. “Brandy was the first thing I ever drank as a kid behind the school hall.”
