Johannesburg – The Western Cape High Court has found that
SA’s nuclear deals with various countries, including Russia, are unlawful. In a decision handed down on Wednesday, the court found
that the country’s deals to add another 9.6MW of power – equivalent to ten
nuclear stations – was not constitutional. It also notes that Parliament has to approve any nuclear
deal, and the Department of Energy has to determine SA’s nuclear needs. The ruling nullifies cooperation agreements  SA has with the US, Russia and South Korea. Under those agreements, potential nuclear vendors in
those countries – such as Westinghouse in the US and Russian state-owned Rosatom
– would assist to develop SA’s nuclear ambitions. Rosatom is seen as a strong contender to secure a contract
to build new nuclear reactors in South Africa. Read also: Rosatom agrees on nuclear safety in newcomer countries The contested nuclear build programme, which will be
driven by Eskom, aims to add 9 600 megawatts of nuclear power to the national
energy grid, though critics say the country does not need and cannot afford
more nuclear reactors. Eskom is expected to issue a request for binding
proposals from potential vendors by the end of June. BUSINESS REPORT
