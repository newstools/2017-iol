Durban - While many have coughed up thousands of rands to be in the VIP marquees at the Vodacom Durban July, many more are choosing to rather go for cheaper options. There are number of fast-food pop-up shops at the Greyville Racecourse that are selling everything from burgers and chicken strips, potatoes on sticks and footlong russians and even a gin station. Ashley Roe of The Gin Tin said that it made sense for them to have a gin station at the Durban July. "It's the biggest event in the social calendar and with gin having such a moment it was a no brainer for us to have a stand here." Fans of gin could choose between local craft gin or the more established foreign brands. The mixologist then use botanics, citrus fruits and pomegranate seeds, to create a unique cocktail.
