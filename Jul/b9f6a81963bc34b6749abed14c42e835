As well as the new matte lip kit, which features a lip liner and lip gloss, Kylie has re-launched the lipstick Candy but with a special birthday twist, because "everybody" loves the original shade. She said: "I can't wait for this, I'm sure you've seen this before, but I wanted to share this with you guy. Limited edition for you guys for my birthday. Yay now you guys can have your own vajazzled rhinestone lipsticks, this shade is Candy, I wanted to do one of my original shades, so everybody loves Candy. These are amazing."
