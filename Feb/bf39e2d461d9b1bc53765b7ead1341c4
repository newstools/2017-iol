Nairobi – Kenya is close to signing an $800 million (R10.5 billion) syndicated loan with four banks to help fund infrastructure projects and support the shilling, according to a person familiar with the
matter.  East Africa's biggest economy was expected to sign the
three-year facility with Citigroup, Standard Bank Group, Standard Chartered and
Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) on Tuesday, the person said, declining to be
identified because he was not authorised to speak on the matter. Kamau Thugge, the Treasury’s principal secretary, did not
answer calls and text messages seeking comment. The government also secured $500 million from lenders led
by the Trade and Development Bank, an east African trade-finance bank based in
Burundi, the person said. The 10-year loan is in addition to the $250m it
raised from the same lenders last month. Debt repayments The loans come as the nation faces debt repayments of
about $8 billion this year, including interest, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Kenya, which has not ruled out a Eurobond sale, may borrow as much
as 250 billion shillings (R31.8 billion) externally in the fiscal year that
begins on July 1, the person said. That is more than the 206 billion shillings
the government said it would raise in budget estimates submitted to parliament
last week. Spokesmen for both Citigroup and Standard Bank referred
questions to the Kenyan Treasury. Standard Chartered and RMB declined to
comment. Kenya plans to raise 154 billion shillings through
external borrowing in the current budget year that ends June 30, to finance a
deficit estimated by the Treasury at 9.6â€†percent of gross domestic product. Kenya will probably prefer a single placement in the
coming 2017-18 fiscal year and sees Eurobonds as a cheaper option, the person
said. A second issue, after the nation raised $2.82bn in debut sales in 2014,
is still under consideration, although the government remains sensitive to the
timing. The state may increase spending to 2.29 trillion
shillings in 2017-18 from 2.23 trillion shillings in 2016-17, according to
Treasury estimates. Expenditure may expand to as much as 2.6 trillion in the
fiscal year starting in July, according to the presidency. Bloomberg
