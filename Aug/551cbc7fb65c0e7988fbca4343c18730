Pretoria - The New Range Rover Velar is now available to order at Land Rover dealers across South Africa, and you can use the Land Rover Configurator to create your own version of what Land Rover says is its most customisable model yet. To start with, it comes in two primary variants - the base Velar and the sportier R-Dynamic. Each of those is available with your choice of Ingenium four-cylinder or Land Rover six-cylinder engines in either petrol or diesel format - and each of those is available in base, S, SE or HSE trim spec. And that’s before you’ve even opened the options catalogue. But wait, as they say, there’s more: The Velar First Edition, available only for the 2018 model year in a single flagship derivative, loaded with every available option, with three-litre power in either petrol or diesel. About the only features that are standard across the range are four-corner air suspension, eight-speed automatic transmissions and all-wheel drive with intelligent driveline dynamics. Consult the catalogueThen it gets up close and personal as you choose from 17 wheel designs, 13 paint colours, and three exterior trim packs. For the interior, choose from 15 material finishes, including premium fabrics from Danish textile firm Kvadrat, as well as a steering wheel trimmed in synthetic suede. The Velar will go on sale in South Africa in the fourth quarter of 2017. PRICES - Velar  Velar R-Dynamic  Velar First Edition    IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
