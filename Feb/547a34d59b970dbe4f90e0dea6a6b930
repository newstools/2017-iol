Hyundai will pull the covers off its all-new Accent sedan next Thursday (16 February) but the carmaker has already revealed a few of its design secrets in the video below, which gives us a glimpse at the rear, side and front of the vehicle. Its most striking feature, from what we see so far, is the new “cascading” grille similar to that on the new Hyundai i30, which was revealed last year. The side and rear views appear to be an evolution of the current Accent. There’s still no word on what will power the new compact sedan, and more specifically whether it will inherit Hyundai’s 1-litre turbopetrol engine or soldier on with the existing normally aspirated 1.6, but all will be revealed soon enough.
