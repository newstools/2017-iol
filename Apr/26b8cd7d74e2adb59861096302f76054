This is according to the “razz-ma-tazz” former sports minister Mbalula after it emerged that the two have kissed and made up after months of quarrelling. Disputing that the squabble had been personal, Mbalula tweeted he had in fact defended Marawa in his days as ANCYL president, when there was an apparent campaign to remove the media host, who presents the 083 Sport with Marawa show on Metro FM between 6pm and 7.30pm. Speaking to our sister the Sunday Tribune this week, Marawa said although he could not predict the future, it was less likely he would have spats with Mbalula again. “What is important now is we have resolved the issue. He is now the Minister of Police and I am involved with sport, so I don’t see what can lead to disagreements. “It was never personal, we just had disagreements based purely on work,” said Marawa. The hatchet was buried with the assistance of DJ Oskido, who organised a meeting between the two men to talk. Mbalula had also instructed his lawyers to file a lawsuit against the sports presenter after Marawa allegedly ignored his letter of demand to apologise for claiming he had wanted to get him axed by the SABC. Mbalula could not be reached for comment this week. Marawa and Mbalula traded many blows with each other, with Marawa referring to Mbalula as “Tarzan” and Mbalula hitting back, calling Marawa “vindictive”. Mbalula is seen as very active and engaging on Twitter and it was not the first time he had involved himself in a twar (Twitter war). He has had thumb wars with radio and TV personality Gareth Cliff, Olympic javelin thrower Sunette Viljoen, as well as News24 editor Adrian Basson, among others. The former ANCYL president is well known for his use of “clapbacks” on Twitter, which are sarcastic comments with the aim of humiliating someone. Sunday Tribune
