The first major hotel project on Grand Anse Beach in Grenada in more than 25 years is expected to open in March 2018. The much anticipated Silversands Grenada is the brainchild of owner Naguib Sawiris who says he fell in love with Grenada. An avid traveller himself, Sawiris was initially weary when he visited Grenada as he believed it would be another in a long string of places he visited. But then he fell in love. On his website, he says, “We arrived in Grand Anse. It is the sight that never gets old. I guessed then that this was a place where happiness would be inevitable. Now I know this is true..” Boasting 43 suites and 9 villas, Silversands is the epitome of luxury and tranquility. The resort boasts a 100 metre pool , the longest in the Caribbean and a spa that has a hammam and sauna. Judging by the pictures online, this beautiful spot will be on the hot list of places to see in 2018. Grenada itself is rich in history. Known as the spice island, it is the biggest exporter of nutmeg and mace. For further information, visit http://www.silversandsgrenada.com/residences/
