Washington - The head of Islamic State in
Afghanistan, Abu Sayed, was killed in a strike on the group's
headquarters in Kunar province earlier this week, the Pentagon
said on Friday. In a statement, Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said the
raid on Tuesday had killed other Islamic State members and would
"significantly disrupt the terror group's plans to expand its
presence in Afghanistan." Reuters
