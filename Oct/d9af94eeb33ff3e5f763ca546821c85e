Police in Kimberley are investigating a case of murder following the death of the 30-year-old man and have called for public assistance in tracing the suspects. In a statement issued on Sunday morning, SAPS head of communication in the Northern Cape, Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi, said that the deceased and a friend were passing the railway line in Colville when they were apparently approached by five men. “One of the suspects allegedly threatened the deceased with a knife, accusing him of being his former cellmate in prison from Greenpoint,” Mooi said. “The deceased explained that he was not that person but when he turned to continue walking, a shot was allegedly fired, fatally wounding him in the head. “The suspects then fled the scene.” The police have requested that anyone who might have any information about this incident, or who is able to assist in tracing the suspects, to please contact Warrant Officer Dibebe on 082 302 0407 or their nearest police station or alternatively call the Crime Stop Line 08600 10111. “All information received will be strictly confidential,” Mooi said.
