Johannesburg - Being called a "stabane" (gay) did not give former deputy education minister Mduduzi Manana the right to assault three women in a Johannesburg nightclub, a Randburg magistrate said as he sentenced him to 12 months imprisonment or a fine of R100 000 on Monday. While handing down his sentence at the Randburg Magistrate's Court, Magistrate Ramsamy Reddy said: "It was degrading for them as women to experience such a degrading act." Reddy added that being called a "stabane" did not call for Manana to assault Mandisa Duma, Noluthando Mahlaba and Thina Mopipa. Manana was also ordered to complete 500 hours of community service. Manana had been convicted of three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm after pleading guilty to the charges. The charges relate to the assault of three women at Cubana in Fourways on August 6. African News Agency
