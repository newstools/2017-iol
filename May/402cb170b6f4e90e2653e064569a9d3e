It’s been made possible by research into new resin and rubber compounds that not only make the tyre more flexible – without overheating and losing its properties – but also allow greater freedom in design, as well as the obvious benefit of preventing punctures.  The Air Free tyre is made entirely of recycled materials, says Bridgestone; it plans to begin marketing e Beta version through various bicycle companies within two years. Bridgestone says it’s looking at new ways of designing bicycles using air-free tyres, as well as using the technology in other types of tyre. One possibility that springs to mind immediately is that it could be used to make a run-fast tyre without the stiff, harsh-running sidewalls of today’s run-flats – after all the tyres on the bicycle in the picture have no sidewalls at all.
