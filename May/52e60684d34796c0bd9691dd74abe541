Tessa Connover (Heigl) is barely coping with the end of her marriage when her ex-husband, David (Stults), becomes happily engaged to Julia Banks (Dawson) - not only bringing Julia into the home they once shared but also into the life of their daughter, Lily. Trying to settle into her new life, Julia believes she has finally met the man of her dreams, the man who can help her put her own troubled past behind her.  But Tessa’s jealousy soon takes a pathological turn: she will stop at nothing to turn Julia’s dream into her ultimate nightmare. Heigl has finally found the perfect role and it’s playing an uptight, cold hearted b****. And by no means is this a stellar performance by the actress who is still suffering from the Shonda Rhimes curse. This is one of those rare occasions that a movie is so bad it’s good and it’s mostly due to the ridiculous premise of the film. The easiest way to explain it is to compare it with a bad version of Get Out with a female lead. This thriller is unintentionally one of the best comedies of the year. Dawson gives her all but this screenplay is filled with so many plot holes it makes a road in the Eastern Cape look like an easy drive. No, really. The fact that Dawson’s character and her soon-to-be husband have no idea of his ex-wife’s mental instability is ridiculous. The lengths to which Heigl’s character goes to try and get rid of Dawson’s character is something that should be in a straight-to-DVD movie. Yet, it’s played as a serious, real-life situation. Director Di Novi and the screenwriters are to blame for the distinct soapie scent that pervades Unforgettable. Dawson is too good an actress for this film and I am baffled as to why she said yes to this project. It is beneath her. This movie is sure to flop hard at the box office. The fact that Warner Bros is releasing this movie the same day as the new Pirates of the Caribbean film shows their lack of confidence in the film.
