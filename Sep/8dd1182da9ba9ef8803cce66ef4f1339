Hannover, Germany - The Aventura one-tonner, specially built for the Frankfurt motor show, is not so much a concept as a blueprint for future production models, says Volkwagen Commercial Vehicles, as the Amarok, now with some serious muscle from the long-awaited three-litre turbodiesel, finally moves into the big league of leisure vehicles. And it’s not just a show car, either; the Aventura’s V6 TDI has been remapped to deliver 190kW via an eight-speed automatic transmission and permanent all-wheel drive with mechanical differential lock. But it’s the blinding yellow paint job and all the extras that are going to cause a stir at Frankfurt, starting with LED daytime running lights underlining the bi-xenon headlights and lashings of chrome on the beefed-up grille, the ‘styling bar’ (we’re not allowed to call it a roll bar anymore) over the load bed, the side sills, mirrors and rear bumper. Then there’s the aluminium-look bash plates and specially polished 19 inch rims, as well as a lockable, waterproof, aluminium roll cover for the load bed. The cabin is trimmed in black leather with yellow contrast stitching and chromed trim elements; it features 14-way adjustable seats, a multifunction leather steering wheel with shift paddles, satnav, park pilot with a rear-view camera and a new black roof liner that will actually be available on future production Amaroks. Dark Label One of which will be the Amarok Dark Label - a limited-edition model based on the Comfortline trim spec, finished in a deep satin grey with a matt black styling bar, door handles and side mirrors, black sill pipes and glossy 18 inch rims in very dark grey. It’ll be available in Europe from the second quarter of 2018 with a choice of two three-litre V6 turbodiesels - a 120kW version with a six-speed manual ‘box and either rear-wheel or on-demand all-wheel drive, or a 150kW with either the six-speed manual and on-demand AWD, or the new eight-speed automatic transmission and permanent AWD, with prices starting from €33 714 (R519 160). No decision has yet been made as to whether or when the Amarok Dark Label will be released in South Africa. IOL Motoring
