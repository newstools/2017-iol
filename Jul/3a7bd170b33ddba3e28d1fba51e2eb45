Pretoria - An 11-year-old boy was in serious but stable condition after a swarm of bees attacked him in Pretoria on Thursday, paramedics said. Netcare 911 spokesperson Nick Dollman said the boy who is allergic to bee stings, was stung several times and required medical intervention. "Advanced life support paramedics treated him at a safe distance from the location of the initial attack and carefully removed multiple stings from his head and several from his neck. They removed approximately 13 stings and transported him to hospital for further medical care and monitoring. His condition was serious but stable." He said  several people were stung by bees at a shopping complex in Pretoria North on Thursday afternoon. "Paramedics assessed approximately 10 people who had been stung including two women who got out of their car to help an elderly woman who at that time was the focus of the bees attention. All of these people were in a stable condition and refused further medical assistance." African News Agency
