Stuttgart - The current Mercedes-AMG range already leaves buyers spoiled for choice, but there is yet another derivative in the pipeline. According to Automotive News, AMG is working on a new range of ‘53’ models that will first see light of day in next year’s new Mercedes CLS, which has yet to be revealed. The new CLS 53 AMG will reportedly be powered by AMG’s version of the all-new straight-six turbopetrol engine that Mercedes-Benz revealed last year. Codenamed M256, the new engine, which is Merc’s first straight six since the late nineties, produces 270kW in the facelifted S-Class that’s due in SA soon, but AMG’s version of the motor will reportedly produce over 315kW. It is also speculated that the engine will be mated to an electric motor for a performance and efficiency boost. Expect the ‘43’ designation to eventually span a wide range of models, including the E-Class, GLE, C-Class and GLC. An output in the region of 315kW, though in no way set in stone, will ensure that the new '53' derivatives slot comfortably above the current ‘43’ AMGs, which produce between 270kW and 295kW, but without stepping on the toes of the big-daddy twin-turbo V8 ‘63’ AMGs, which offer between 350kW and 450kW depending on which engine bay they’re slotted into. In fact, don’t be surprised if ‘53’ derivatives replace the ‘43’ AMGs in some model ranges.
