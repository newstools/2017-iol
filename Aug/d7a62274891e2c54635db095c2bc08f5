CAPE TOWN - Toyota South Africa on Tuesday announced an initiative to increase its support to the taxi industry. According to a statement, the company is set to introduce a complementary 3-year or 60 000km service plan for all new Ses’fikile taxis sold from August 1. With the service plan, taxi owners and operators are assured of free safety inspections and comprehensive services with Genuine Toyota parts for the taxi’s first 60 000 km.

Since then, Toyota has upgraded the vehicle seating, introduced more cost-effective, locally-sourced components, kept the vehicle compliant to all regulatory requirements and subsidised Ses’fikile service or repair parts to the value of R5m per year,” concluded Kirby.
