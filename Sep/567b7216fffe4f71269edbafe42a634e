DURBAN - "Age ain’t nothing but a number and form is everything," coaches like to say in American football. But in rugby in South Africa you sometimes wonder if coaches err on the side of caution when a bright new thing explodes on the scene. South Africa used to be terribly conservative in blooding youngsters but in the modern era there is thankfully an improvement in giving the “lighties” a shot. A lot, of course, depends on the coach. Heyneke Meyer was at one end of the spectrum, picking only the tried and tested and even coaxing 37-year-old Victor Matfield out of retirement for the 2015 World Cup. Then you had a polar opposite in Dick Muir, who had a devil-may-care attitude to selection and famously discovered an unknown 19-year-old named JP Pietersen in Durban club rugby and made him a World Cup winner in a year. In Australia, it is not uncommon for raw young talent to be thrust onto the world stage. Maybe it is because they have much fewer players. Or it is because the coaches know a good thing when they see one. But it can go wrong. James O’Connor was 18 when he debuted for the Wallabies in 2008 and Test rugby was old hat for him by his 21st birthday. It wasn’t long before stardom got the better of him and a series of incidents in nightclubs and airports derailed him. He last played for the Wallabies in 2013. The All Blacks have the best way of ensuring a shiny new pin is the real deal or not. They have an “apprenticeship” scheme where they pick the likes of an Ardie Savea for their November tour to Europe but he will be told beforehand that he is not going to play. The coaches can have a good look at the youngster and the player soaks up the environment and gets hungrier than ever for the jersey. Lately at the Springboks, we have seen S’bu Nkosi, 21, called up by Allister Coetzee after a startling first season in top flight rugby, while Curwin Bosch, 20, was with the Boks earlier this year but then released for Currie Cup duty.  Goodluck with this next chapter Champion. 🏆 go out and enjoy every minute with the Boks! You deserve it brother 🏆🏆🏆 #bokcallup #SA'slomu 😉 A post shared by Curwin Bosch (@curwin_bosch) on Sep 23, 2017 at 10:21am PDT  In the case of Nkosi, there would have been long discussions between Sharks coach Robert du Preez and Coetzee regarding the player and his ability to take to the step up. Nkosi has it all - flawless wing play, temperament and courage - and his selection should be applauded. There should be more of these type of selections to ignite the Boks. Western Province bristle with game-breakers and it is pleasing that Dillyn Leyds has been recognised when for years Cheslin Kolbe was not. Bosch? Well, he just gets better and better. While we have been told that there is a long-term plan for him and that he will get another shot with the Boks when he has brushed up his defence, Coetzee will not be able to leave him out much longer if Elton Jantjies continues to be erratic at international level, and while Handre Pollard is still way off the pace after almost two years out of rugby. Is Bosch’s tackling that bad? It has certainly improved since it was exposed by the England Under-20 team last year when Bosch was at fullback for the Baby Boks, and in any case, a good national coach can make a plan for a flyhalf with defensive frailties. Bosch is ready and red hot and Coetzee must not shy away from making a bold call at flyhalf if Jantjies again blows hot and cold. The Mercury   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
