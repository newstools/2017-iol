LONDON – Dropped New Zealand wing Julian Savea is set to show the world champions what they are missing after being included in the Barbarians squad for their match against the All Blacks at Twickenham on November 4. Nicknamed ‘ The Bus’, Savea – who has scored an impressive 46 tries in just 54 Tests – was dropped from New Zealand’ s Rugby Championship squad in August after the return of the fit-again Nehe Milner-Skudder. Savea had previously been a regular in New Zealand’s No 11 jersey since 2012 but, having been axed on his 27th birthday, his international future is uncertain. World Cup winner Savea, the leading try-scorer at the 2015 edition in England, last played for New Zealand in the drawn third Test against the British and Irish Lions in Auckland in July. All Black coach Steve Hansen, speaking after omitting Savea, insisted the Wellington flyer was far from finished at Test level. “Julian’s been a very, very good All Black for us and done some great things – I feel for him a wee bit at this stage,” Hansen said. “He’s disappointed and so he should be. He’s done a lot in the jersey, he’s enhanced it when he’s worn it, and his time’s not over.” Savea has been joined in the Barbarians squad by another New Zealand World Cup winner in scrumhalf Andy Ellis.
