Morocco beat the Elephants 1-0 in Oyem, Gabon on Tuesday, courtesy of a brilliant Rachid Alioui goal, to seal their place in the quarter-finals by finishing second in Group C. The loss meant that Ivory Coast finished third in the group and have been eliminated from the tournament. Renard was pleased with his teams' performance against the defending champions, but advised them to stay grounded.  "I think that when you get a win like this, you have to stay realistic. We beat a team from CÃ´te d'Ivoire on a bumpy field and that levelled things out," Renard said. "There are teams superior to us in the African Cup, but when they are in front of us, they will have to prove it. Ghana have finished first in Group D and look good but in past matches I have had some luck playing them. Hopefully the good star will continue to watch over me." Ivory Coast coach Michel Dussuyer was naturally downbeat. "I am extremely disappointed. I am thinking about all the Ivorians who feel so sad and let down by our exit," he said. "I know that there will be debate about my possible resignation. I am disappointed because our objectives were not achieved."  Morocco will be joined in the quarter-finals by DR Congo, who finished first in Group C after two wins and a draw. African News Agency (ANA)
