Paul Pogba scored one and created another on his return from a two-month injury layoff to lead Manchester United to a 4-1 win over Newcastle United at Old Trafford on Saturday as they maintained their 100 percent home record. United had to come from behind though to secure the three points, which keep them eight behind leaders Manchester City, after Dwight Gayle had fired Rafa Benitez's side ahead in the 14th minute. France international Pogba's cleverness on the ball created the equaliser in the 37th minute as he chipped a cross to compatriot Anthony Martial, who headed home at the back post. Jose Mourinho's side went ahead just before the break when Chris Smalling headed in a superb deep cross from Ashley Young and then Pogba made it 3-1 in the 54th minute with a tap-in after Marcus Rashford headed down a Romelu Lukaku cross. Lukaku, who had not scored in his last seven games in all competitions, grabbed his 12th of the season 20 minutes from the end and Mourinho later brought on Zlatan Ibrahimovic for his first appearance since suffering a knee ligament injury in April.
