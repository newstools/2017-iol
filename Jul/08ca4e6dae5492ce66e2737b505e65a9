Cristiano Ronaldo is set to become a father for the fourth time. The 32-year-old Real Madrid soccer superstar secretly welcomed twins Eva and Mateo, who are believed to have been born via a surrogate in the US, into the world last month, and the sportsman has now confirmed he will be expanding his brood with his 22-year-old girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez who is believed to be expecting her first child. When asked if he was excited about his next impending arrival by El Mundo's website La Otra Cr√≥nica, Ronaldo - who also has seven-year-old son Ronaldo Jr. - said: "Yes, very much." Although the Portuguese soccer ace has three children already, he has yet to get to grips with parenting duties such as nappy changing.
When asked how he copes with his children's diapers during a visit to a restaurant in Ibiza, he said: "I'm not very skilled at that, but I try." Ronaldo is still basking in the joy surrounding the arrival of his two "precious" children.
