The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is going through a difficult time financially. This can explain the reasoning behind a suggestion that laptops,tablets and other devices will be licensed in the same way as televisions. The challenge with this proposal is that it lacks the understanding that SABC needs to innovate in order to survive. It lacks the understanding that one of the reasons behind challenges experienced at SABC besides leadership, it has not embraced innovation. Due to innovation and adoption of technology by youth, there’s a shift from traditional television to other forms of accessing video and audio content. In future, we will even see virtual reality devices taking over from television. Mr Guma,SABC CEO, is probably aware of this reality. If the leadership at SABC does not innovate, it will soon license the eyes of South Africans, here’s why: Technology is moving beyond devices to connecting technology chips and human beings. Recently, Elon Musk announced a new venture (Neuralink) that will merge Artificial Intelligence and human brain. The company, which is still in the earliest stages of existence and has no public presence whatsoever, is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices.
