Indianapolis, Indiana – Fernando Alonso survived his first Brickyard "Happy Hour" on Tuesday, the double Formula One world champion getting a taste of what he can expect when he lines up for the Indianapolis 500 later in May. The practice session was only the third at the famous oval for Alonso, who will miss the next stop on the F1 calendar, the Monte Carlo Grand Prix, to race the Indianapolis 500 in a bid to claim the second jewel in motor racing's Triple Crown – victories at the Monaco Grand Prix, Indianapolis 500 and Le Mans. After what was basically a shakedown of his McLaren Honda Andretti Autosport car on Monday, Alonso put down 117 laps around the sprawling four-kilometre oval and got a feel for what it might be like on race day participating in what is known as "Happy Hour". The final 60 minutes of the day-long practice session saw most of the 33 cars attempting to qualify for the 28 May classic take to the track, simulating race conditions for the unfamiliar Alonso, who has put learning to drive in the traffic and turbulence as his biggest challenge. The Spaniard will have to find his comfort zone and some more speed if he is to add an Indy 500 win to his resume that includes two wins at Monaco. Powerhouse Penske Alonso produced the 24th best effort of the 33 cars on the track on Tuesday with a top speed of 353.646km/h, well below the 357km/h mph lap he put down on Monday. Powerhouse Penske Racing dominated Day Two with Australian Will Power at the top of timing charts, posting the fastest lap of 359.402km/h, followed by team-mate Brazilian Helio Castroneves, who goes into the 28 May race chasing a record-equalling fourth Indy 500 win. "This is the big one, and we are working as a team trying to get the best out of it," Castroneves. "We've just got to focus on our work."   Reuters  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
