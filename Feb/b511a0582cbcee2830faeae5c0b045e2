LONDON – Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino labelled Harry Kane one of the world’s best strikers after a third hat trick in nine games helped the London side demolish Stoke City 4-0 on Sunday. Kane’s three goals came between the 14th and 37th minutes, giving him 22 in all competitions for the season. “He’s playing at a very good level,” Pochettino told the BBC. “He’s one of the best strikers in the world. He deserves it because he’s a great professional.” The Argentine coach was also delighted with midfielder Dele Alli, who was sent off for a wild challenge at Wembley as Spurs went out of the Europa League to Belgium’s Gent on Thursday. “Dele is very mature and a great boy,” he added. “I am very pleased for him, he had a difficult few days, but it was a good response. He was fantastic on the pitch.” An eighth successive home win in the Premier League – and 10th in all competitions at White Hart Lane – put Tottenham second in the table, but with a big gap still to make up on London rivals Chelsea. “Ten points is a big gap, but we keep going and believe,” Pochettino said. “We (will) try to put on pressure.” Reuters
