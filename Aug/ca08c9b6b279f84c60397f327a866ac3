She said: "Usually I go on a trip every year and I like to do something special and big. This year I'm just feeling family vibes. I just want to be around my family and my friends and just do something cute."

She said: "A jewellery holder. I needed a new something to carry my jewellery in. That's literally something random. That's the only thing I can think of. "Other than that I really don't want anything. I don't care. I'm doing special charity things on my birthday and I like sentimental things, because the materialistic things, if I want something, I'll usually get it myself. I don't really like when people buy things for me."
