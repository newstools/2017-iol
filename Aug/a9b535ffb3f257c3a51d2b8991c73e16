Bracknell, United Kingdom - Honda has revealed its facelifted Jazz ahead of its world debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September. While the hatchback retains its practical body shape, Honda has sharpened up the styling at the front and back. Upfront it bears a closer resemblance to the latest Civic, with new headlights, bumper and grille all conforming to Honda’s ‘Solid Wing Face’ design language. At the rear, the Jazz gets new lower trim strips that are styled like a grille. Mechanical changes are few, with the only engine news being the availability of a 96kW 1.5-litre i-Vtec petrol engine in Europe for the first time, but it remains unclear whether this would replace the 88kW 1.5 i-Vtec that’s currently sold in SA. The 96kW 1.5 will be available with a revised CVT constantly variable transmission. Local specifications have yet to be confirmed, but hopefully Honda will offer its new ‘Dynamic’ trim grade locally. The Jazz Dynamic gets racier exterior and interior styling, including a thinner front splitter, LED headlights, side skirts, roof spoiler and gloss black 16-inch alloys. Inside it gets ‘pinstripe’ upholstery and orange stitching on the leather-wrapped steering wheel. In terms of features and gadgets, upper versions get an 18cm touchscreen infotainment system as well as Forward Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning and Traffic Sign Recognition. According to Honda SA, we can expect to see the updated Jazz on local shores in "early 2018".
