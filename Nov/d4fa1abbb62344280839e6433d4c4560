Los Angeles Auto Show - Lexus has announced a stretched version of its RX SUV, with seating for seven, and the newcomer will be coming to South Africa in 2018, although exact dates and specifications and range info will only be made available nearer to the time. Created after numerous requests from customers, the new RX ‘L’ models are 110mm longer than the standard RX five-seaters and have to steeper C-pillar for the sake of third-row headroom. But rather than just treating these back row occupants as forgotten entities as carmakers so often do, Lexus has actually made an effort to keep them comfortable. Designed to offer the same level of comfort and luxury as the second row, the third row has its own separate aircon vents and cupholders, while stowing the seats away is dead easy thanks to a power folding mechanism. Overseas customers will get to choose between the RX 350L, which is powered by a 216kW normally aspirated petrol engine, and the RX 450hL which employs that same motor in a petro-electric hybrid drivetrain that boasts a system output of 230kW.
