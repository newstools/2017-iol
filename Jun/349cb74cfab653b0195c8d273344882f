The All Blacks are coming to Cape Town this year! Local rugby fans will thrill to the performance of the haka on October 7, when the world champions New Zealand play their first Test in the city since 2008 in a Rugby Championship clash against the Springboks. A highly-placed source in local rugby confirmed late on Thursday that Newlands rugby stadium had received the required security certificate for the Rugby Championship match against Allister Coetzee’s team. SA Rugby had awarded the match to Newlands in May, but the venue was subject to the outcome of an application for a safety certificate for the grand old ground. Had clearance not been granted, the choice clash could have been moved to another city, or possibly to the Cape Town Stadium. Councillor Alderman JP Smith, the mayoral committee member responsible for safety, security and social services in the City of Cape Town, confirmed that Newlands rugby stadium was granted the safety certificate on Thursday. Smith said: “I can confirm that the safety certificate has been signed. The senior engineer in the city signed off on it, as well as the most senior safety and security (official) from Disaster Management.”  The last time the All Blacks played in Cape Town was in 2008, when they beat South Africa 19-0 in a Tri-Nations game at Newlands. In their other home Rugby Championship fixture, the Boks face Australia in Bloemfontein on September 30. * This story has been updated. @WynonaLouw   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
