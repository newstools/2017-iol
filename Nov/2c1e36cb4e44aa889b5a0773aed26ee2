In today’s fast-paced work and social environment, where technology allows for 24/7 connectivity, taking time to switch off and recharge is critical. 
 
According to Priya Naicker, Advice Manager at Old Mutual Personal Finance, even the most career-focused among us can fall victim to burnout if stress is not managed appropriately. Taking a break is essential for healthy living and maintaining high levels of career performance. Leave is an important tool for both employers and employees as it helps to optimise performance and productivity over the long term, by contributing to a more healthy and engaged workforce, says Naicker.
 
“Employees often avoid taking their leave to prove their commitment or because they are over concerned about not meeting deadlines if they take more than an occasional short break. The important thing to remember is that sometimes you need to slow down to speed up and taking time off is a good way to re-evaluate your goals and assess whether you’re on track to sustain your professional momentum.”
 
There are many different ways to rest, recover and recharge, so the trick is to find the one that best suits your needs and budget. For some, a trip locally or abroad is the ideal way to disconnect and escape, while for others the freedom to explore and experience favourite attractions from the comfort of a home stay is its own reward.
 
Whatever your preference, Naicker says that planning for your vacation goals can give you a blueprint for success, turning your dreams into reality without sacrificing your financial well-being.
