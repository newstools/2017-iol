If the Sunfoil Series is going to serve up such exciting contests this season, the officials may soon have to revert back to charging an entrance fee. With both the Cape Cobras and Warriors captains doing their utmost to fashion a result with a positive declarations , it left the Cobras requiring 252 runs off 58 overs to win the game on Sunday at St George’s Park in Port Elizabeth after the home side declared their second innings on 189/9. It was actually a spirited performance from the Cobras bowlers, with Proteas T20 seamer Dane Paterson leading the way with 3/31. Paterson was ably backed up by Lizaad Williams (2/55), Dane Piedt (2/56) and Tshepo Moreki (2/33). The Cobras needed a solid start if they were going to chase down the runs in the afternoon, and seemed to be on their way before first-innings centurion Pieter Malan fell for 19 off just 30 balls. Unfortunately for the Cobras, they lost veteran opener Andrew Puttick just seven runs later to leave the visitors at 39/2. The other first-innings centurion, Zubayr Hamza, kept the fight going for the Cobras with another well-compiled 41 off only 64 balls (4x4, 1x6), but the former Rondebosch Boys’ High prodigy did not have the support he needed for the Cobras to pose a realistic challenge. With Jason Smith, Justin Ontong and Aviwe Mgijima all falling in quick succession, the scale seemed to be titling in the favour of the Warriors, but young wicket-keeper Kyle Verreynne ensured there would be no further alarms with an undefeated 30. It was the second week in succession that the rookie gloveman was at the crease when the stumps were drawn with the Cobras on 131/6, and the 20-year-old is quickly developing a reputation as a man the Cobras can depend on in a crisis. @ZaahierAdams  IOL Sport Like IOL Sport on Facebook
