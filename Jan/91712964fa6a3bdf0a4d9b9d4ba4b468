It all started back in 2013 for Springbok Sevens superstar Seabelo Senatla - the tries, the exhilarating runs and the kind of flair that saw him reach the highest ranks on the World Sevens circuit at just 23. And this weekend, the World Sevens Player of the Year will get to thrill at the very same stadium where he made his international bow, the Westpac Stadium in Wellington. But this tournament is an extra special one for Senatla, as he will be chasing the Blitzboks’ all-time try-scoring record, held by former Sevens great Fabian Juries, and he’s not far off. Not far off at all. The speedster is only seven tries short of the record, with Juries, who retired from international Sevens in 2010, on 179 and Senatla on 172. But despite this, Senatla said that breaking the record won’t be his focus this weekend. “The record is in the back of my mind, but I am not stressing about it," Senatla said. “We need to go out and do the work first and if the tries come, they will come. If they don’t, so be it. I am not going to chase the record and not do my job in the team first. Although he won’t be stressing about it, he admitted that it would be "great" to reach that milestone at the same venue where he scored his first international try. “I am going out there to do my best for the team and if the tries come, it will be great,” he smiled. Meanwhile, Werner Kok, is set to reach a milestone of his own when he plays in his 100th match for the Blitzboks in Wellington. “I was not even aware of the fact that I will be playing in my 100th match, but that will not change my approach,” said Kok. “Every match, pulling that jersey over your head, is special. I can remember the first time and I will remember the 100th one as well. Cape Times
