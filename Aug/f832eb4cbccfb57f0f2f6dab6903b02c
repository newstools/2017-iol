A hotel among the trees, now that is what I would like to experience. If you are travelling to Sweden, the Treehotel inspired by the movie E.T., is just the place you should go. Treehotel offers an unique hotel stay with contemporary design in the middle of nature in Harads, near the Lule River. The hotel is the brainchild of Kent and Britta Lindvall, two swedish Lapland locals who created the spot to be close to their village and their roots. On their website, the pair says: “We live here, we love our village, we wanted to earn a living and we looked at what we could do with what we have here.” It was during a fishing trip to Russia with some friends, three of which were Sweden’s foremost architects named Bertil Harstrom, Thomas Sandell and Marten Cyren when Kent mentioned his idea to create a hotel. Each one designed a room and so began the story of the Treehotel. The rooms were designed like a UFO, bird’s nest, a cabin, a mirror cube and  a blue cone that changes colour to orange. They call their spot “a childhood dream with a touch of luxury and flair.”
Here is how it looks:
