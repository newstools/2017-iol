Cape Town - The rise of domestic violence during the festive season effects families from across the globe and from all walks of life.  It has a devastating effect not only on family units, but children are left with mental or even physical scars for rest of the lives.
 
In South Africa, a large number of children experience or have witnessed multiple forms of violence in the home on a regular basis, often by someone they know and trust.  
 
Global child advocacy and humanitarian organisation, World Vision South Africa has urged South Africans to be extra vigilant during the festive season and said that cases of violence need to reported immediately. "The Festive Season should be a time of celebration and rest, however, often households are plagued by stressful situations due to unrealistic expectations, financial instability and substance abuse which all lead to violence," said interim national director at World Vision South Africa, Bhekimpilo Khanye adding that safety from violence is important for children to thrive.
 
“The reality is that we cannot afford to turn a blind eye; if we establish a no-nonsense culture - where incidents of violence are reported - we can put a stop to global epidemic that affects the most vulnerable in our societies.” If you are aware of any domestic violence, here is a list of numbers to contact: SAPS Crime Stop 08600 1011 Women Abuse Helpline 0800 150 150  Childline 0800 055 555 Department of Social Development’s (DSD) domestic violence helpline 0800 428 4282.
