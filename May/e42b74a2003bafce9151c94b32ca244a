Affairs in the workplace are alive and well, as nearly four out of every 10 women who say their cheating habit started when things became hot and heavy with a colleague or boss, according to results released from a revealing new survey. The survey, conducted by VictoriaMilan, asked 5 127 of its active female members who it was that tempted them to cross the line of lust and have an affair for the very first time. Office romances have been steaming up time sheets for decades – most famously the dalliance between former President Bill Clinton and White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Pop culture has also been inspired by such affairs, referred to in the hit song Yes Boss by Mikkel Hess, and cult classic film, The Secretary, starring James Spader. A massive 38 percent of women – almost four out of every 10 – said their first adulterous adventure was with a colleague or boss at work, meaning the watertight old excuse of "I had to work late…" now has some serious question marks hanging over it. Anonymous flings are the second most popular option. 21 percent of women indulged in an online flirtation as their first act of extramarital lust, while 14 percent decided to hook up with a stranger while they were on a wild night out. Keeping things between friends isn’t a favorite item on the menu – just nine percent of women said they decided to blow off steam and have their first affair with a friend. Friends, and the partners of friends are unlikely to get a front row ticket to the action as well, as only eight percent would slip between the sheets with their partner’s friend and only five percent of women saying they had made a move on their friend’s partner. Cleverly, women are unlikely to engage in a steamy love affair with someone close to the family home – just two percent of women said they threw caution to the wind and jumped into bed with a neighbour.
