CAPE TOWN – It’s been another frustrating Super Rugby campaign for Pat Lambie, but the Sharks captain is fit again and will feature against the Western Force on Saturday. Springbok flyhalf Lambie has been sidelined since sustaining a back injury against the Waratahs on March 11 in Durban, which resulted in fractured vertebrae in his lower back. He was set to be out for six to eight weeks, so his return on Saturday is according to schedule. The Sharks announced on Thursday that Lambie will play off the bench, though, as SA Under-20 star Curwin Bosch will continue in the No 10 jersey against the Force. Another boost on the injury front sees Kobus van Wyk return at right wing in place of veteran Odwa Ndungane, while Sbu Nkosi will make his Super Rugby debut at left wing, with Springbok Lwazi Mvovo getting a breather this week. Etienne Oosthuizen regains his starting berth at lock, with Stephan Lewies shifting to the bench and Ruan Botha moving to No 5. The other Oosthuizen, tighthead prop Coenie, is also reinstated at No 3 for Lourens Adriaanse. Saturday’s clash kicks off at 3.05pm at Kings Park.
