The deal is done – Mohamed Salah is now a Liverpool player! After weeks of speculation about an imminent transfer, the Merseyside club finally announced the deal on social media late on Thursday night. Egyptian star Salah scored 29 goals in 65 matches for Roma in the Serie A over two seasons. The 25-year-old Salah has agreed a “long-term contract”, according to a statement on the Liverpool website, after completing a medical on Thursday. He will officially start life as a Liverpool player on July 1, with manager Jurgen Klopp having also promised further activity in the transfer market in the off-season as he plans for the Uefa Champions League qualifying round after ending fourth in the Premier League last season.   “I’m very excited to be here. I’m very happy. I will give 100 percent and give everything for the club. I really want to win something for this club,” Salah told the Liverpool website. “We have a great team and very good players. I was watching the games last year, and everyone was giving 100 percent to win something. “Everyone can see the coach gives everything. I hope to see that together, we can give everything to win something for the club, for the supporters and for us.” Left winger Salah has earned 52 caps for Egypt, and scored 29 goals. @ashfakmohamed IOL Sport   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
