JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's National Treasury said on Wednesday it had appointed Ian Stuart as acting deputy director-general for the budget office. It said Stuart would take over from Michael Sachs who had requested a lateral transfer from National Treasury to other areas of public service earlier this month. Local media reported earlier this month that Sachs had quit in protest over political interference in the national budget process. Former Treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile quit in April after his former boss Pravin Gordhan was sacked in a cabinet reshuffle. - AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY
