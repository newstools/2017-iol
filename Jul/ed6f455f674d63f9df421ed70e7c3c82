 London - Police are hunting two rapists in Birmingham who attacked a 15-year-old girl in separate incidents on the same night. The first attack happened when the teenager was approached by a man who raped her in a train station. After the attack, the girl managed to flag down a passing car. She accepted a lift from the driver and was raped for a second time. The girl was attacked the first time between 7pm on Tuesday and 2am the following day at Witton Station, near Villa Park, in Birmingham. A man approached the victim and led her to a secluded part of the station, where the attack took place. Shortly afterwards, the victim, in an agitated state, left the area and stopped a passing vehicle to ask for help. She got in the car but was then sexually assaulted for the second time that night by the motorist, who is believed to be a different offender. The victim then returned home and the police were called. Detective Chief Inspector Tony Fitzpatrick, from British Transport Police, said: "This was a horrifying ordeal for this young girl and we have specially trained officers supporting her. "It is now vitally important we investigate exactly what happened on Wednesday morning. "My detectives are currently examining all available CCTV in an effort to identify the offenders and whilst these inquiries are made, we are keen to speak with any potential witnesses." The first rapist is described as Asian in his early 20s, with light skin, brown eyes, skinny build and 6ft tall. He wore a grey tracksuit and black trainers. The second rapist is also described as an Asian man in his early 20s, around 5ft 6in of large build with a tight beard. He wore a blue jumper and black jeans. Daily Mail
