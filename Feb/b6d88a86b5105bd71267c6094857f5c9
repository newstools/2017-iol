Springbok flyhalf Handre Pollard will lead the Bulls for the first time since his appointment when they take on the Chiefs in their Super Rugby warm-up game in Brisbane next week. Pollard was confirmed as the Bulls captain for the upcoming Super Rugby season until regular captain and former Springbok captain Adriaan Strauss returns from injury which is likely to be in round four of the competition. Next weekâ€™s game against the Chiefs will be the Bulls second preseason friendly after they put to the sword an inexperienced Lions side in Harare last week. The Bulls will also participate in the Brisbane Global Tens at the Suncorp Stadium where they have been pooled with other former Super Rugby champions in thew Brumbies and Highlanders and they could possibly face the Western Force, reigning Super Rugby champions the Hurricanes and former French and European champions Toulon. "This will be an interesting trip for us, as we have not done this before," said coach, Nollis Marais. "It does give us time together to work as a squad and that is very valuable, especially this time of our pre-season. The guys are keen to give it a go and we have a clear understanding of what we want to achieve on this trip."
