Using 3D technology, the Scan Pyramids Project allows visitors wearing headsets to take a guided tour inside the Grand Gallery, the Queen’s Chamber and other ancient rooms not normally accessible to the public. Scan Pyramids co-director Mehdi Tayoubi said the void itself is visible on the tour, appearing like a dotted cloud. “What is new in the world of virtual reality is that from now on you are not isolated but there are several of us. You’re in a group, you can take a tour with your family. And you can access places which you usually can’t in the real pyramid.” While partly designed as a fun experience, the “collaborative immersion” project allows researchers to improve the technologies they used to detect the pyramid void and think about what purpose it may have served. When looking through their 3D goggles, visitors can see the enormous stones of the pyramid as if they were real, and walk virtually along its corridors, chambers and hidden spaces.
