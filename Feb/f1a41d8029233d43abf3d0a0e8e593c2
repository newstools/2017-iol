Construction of the Muzimu Tented Camp, which means “The Spirit of Gorongosa”, is set to commence next month and will ultimately consist of only six tents overlooking the Mussicadzi riverbed. Visitors can look forward to a full and first-class safari experience, including game drives and boat excursions. Guests of Muzimu will also have the opportunity to visit Gorongosa Restoration Project. The project sees the adoption of a 21st century conservation model of balancing the needs of wildlife and people. Wildlife has recently rebounded in the park with large animal numbers reaching more than 70 000. The director at Dana Tours, Natalie Tenzer-Silva, said: “We are extremely excited with the opening of the new tented camp in Gorongosa later this year. Gorongosa will provide for a truly authentic African experience with its stunning vistas and ecosystems. “It’s important that we have different tiers of accommodation levels available in the park to suit all budgets.   The location of the lodge on the banks of the Muzikadzi River is in a pristine area and I have every confidence that this will be a popular choice for our guests,” she said.
