Here is our guide on wearing ankle boots with denim jeans: READ:Sweet dreams are made of this 1. Roll the cuff of your jeans just above your boots to show them off. If you tend to wear your skinny jeans every time you’re in the mood to wear ankle boots, you can now change things up by cuffing denim above the ankle -rather tucking jeans into your boots- this allows you to wear other jean styles like straight leg or boyfriend jeans. To cuff your jeans, simply fold the hem of your jeans about 3 cm, and then fold a second time to get the desired length.
