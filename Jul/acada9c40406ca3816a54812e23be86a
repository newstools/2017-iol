Johannesburg - Controversial religious leader Pastor Paseka "Mboro" Motsoeneng on Wednesday announced that he intends to take legal action against the Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Rights Commission. This follows the release of a report by the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL) The report, released on Tuesday, probed the commercialisation of churches in South Africa. The investigation followed reports of irregular practices by some church leaders, which included congregants being made to eat grass, snakes and sprayed with pesticides. According to the CRL, religious leaders and institutions must be registered and pay tax like any other business in South Africa and foreign nationals wishing to open churches in South Africa should undergo a strict vetting process. Mboro, speaking at his Incredible Happenings church in Katlehong, slammed the commission for continually attacking him and painting him in a bad light. "There have been reports against me, accusing me of things I have never done, and tarnishing my integrity," he said. "Certain leaders have received ill-treatment while others are left alone; why are they only keeping track of the things I do." Mboro also slammed CRL chairperson Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, accusing her of lacking integrity and being dishonest. He added that he no longer recognised her because her attacks had become personal. "Whenever reports emerge of pastors feeding people rats, grass, she somehow manages to drag my name into that," he said. Mboro also slammed the report's call for the regulation of churches, saying it was anti-Christ and anti-Mboro while leaving alone those who practise traditionally. In the meantime, Mboro says he will continue giving services but will only focus on those who help him. khanyisile.ngcobo@inl.co.za IOL
