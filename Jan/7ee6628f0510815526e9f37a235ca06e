Johannesburg - Three more municipalities, two in the Free State and one in the North West, have avoided power supply cuts after they reached payment agreements with Eskom, the power utility said on Monday. The three municipalities are Dihlabeng and Masilonyana in the Free State and Mamusa in the North West. &quot;We have always emphasised the fact that electricity interruptions are the last resort available to us, which we have taken agonisingly. We are immensely encouraged by the kind of response we are witnessing presently,&quot; Eskom acting chief executive Matshela Koko said in a statement.&quot;Time has come for the outstanding overdue debt to be honoured in full. Eskom is bent on ensuring that this happens for the sole benefit of, not only Eskom, but the entire South African economy.&quot;Eskom would be monitoring adherence to the payment plans, said Koko.
