Stuttgart - Mercedes-Benz has released a pair of teaser images of its third-generation CLS in a hype-building exercise ahead of its full reveal at the Los Angeles Auto Show next week. The darkened frontal shot shows a new design language inspired by the Mercedes-AMG GT Coupé, and which will also be seen on other mainstream Mercs, including the forthcoming A-Class. As for the shape, recent spy shots doing their rounds on the internet show something of a mild evolution for the so-called four-door coupé. The CLS’s interior, as we see in the other official teaser shot above, will be largely borrowed from its E-Class cousin, with the 62cm dual screen instrument cluster and infotainment combo taking centre stage, but some of the details, such as the quad central air vents, have been jazzed up. The new CLS will share its chassis with the latest E-Class, while its engines are expected to be lifted from that and the latest S-Class range. Stay tuned for more information early next week.
