Maria Sharapova was told on Wednesday that she will have to wait until a May 16 Facebook announcement to discover whether or not she will receive a wildcard into the French Open. The Russian, a two-time champion at Roland Garros, made her return after a 15-month doping ban in Stuttgart on Wednesday but without ranking points she will need a wildcard to get into the main draw of the Grand Slam event she has won twice. "There is a date which has been fixed. There is no reason to make an exception for Maria Sharapova," said French Tennis Federation (FFT) president Bernard Guidicelli. "We will meet with the tournament director Guy Forget on May 15. The decision will be taken and communicated at 1900 (1700GMT) on Facebook on May 16. "I repeat that as of today no decision has been taken. I know that there is strong expectation from the media and fans but we are not casting. This is not a rock-opera." AFP
