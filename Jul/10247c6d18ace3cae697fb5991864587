Opel’s GSI badge is one that needs no introduction to South African petrolheads with memories extending back as far as the eighties, but sadly the sporty sporty label that mainly adorned GTI-rivalling Kadett hatchbacks, has been missing from Opel’s modern line-up. The good news is that Opel in Germany has just revived the GSI badge, but the bad news is that the model in question, an Insignia sedan, is not destined for South Africa. But don’t give up hope just yet. Given the badge’s Kadett history, there’s every reason to believe that Opel will eventually produce a GSI version of the modern Astra hatchback and that one would surely be on the short-list for Opel’s new local distributor, the Williams Hunt group, which given its history with the brand, would surely appreciate GSI heritage. While that remains pure speculation for now, the Insignia GSI is for real, for European buyers at least, and has all the ingredients of an enticing sports sedan. It’s powered by a 191kW/400Nm 2-litre turbopetrol engine, which sends its power to all four wheels via a multi-mode eight-speed automatic gearbox with steering-mounted paddles. The GSI also has an appropriately sporty styling kit and rides on 20-inch rims, while the lowered FlexRide chassis offers three selectable modes: Standard, Tour and Sport.
