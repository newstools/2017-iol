This Oscar pistorius movie is kaka, biggest movie lie ever. Reeva Steenkamp was a slut that was after Oscar's money and you all know it!!😠😡😡 — Johann Nel (@JohannNel9) November 19, 2017  I really disappointed in this Oscar Pistorius movie it was poorly done and just seem downright fake😔 — xo_chantal_xo (@walcottchantal) November 12, 2017  That Oscar Pistorius movie is one of the worst things I've ever watched in my life! — Lebo (@Leebuu) November 18, 2017  This Oscar Pistorius movie is such crap. The people's accents are so weird they can't even pronounce the character's surnames properly. Lifetime please stop making such unnecessary and senseless  movies. Respect South Africans and let us tell our own stories. Epic failure — Mamorena (@mamorenakhasu) November 18, 2017   Watching Oscar Pistorius: Blade runner killer on #LifeTime Pathetic production! Irresponsible placements of old SA flag. Overall bullshit! Adjusting facts.  — Donnavan (@donno30) November 18, 2017  I watched the Oscar Pistorius movie last night.... I’m annoyed & hacked that I wasted my time. — Tshepi Vundla (@TshepiVundla) November 20, 2017  The Oscar Pistorius movie is upsetting.  They couldn't even use South African actors?  Or at least force an accent? — Mshengu_Tshabalala (@siz_kele) November 19, 2017  Woooow...the Oscar Pistorius movie is the trashiest of trash 😱  such an irresponsible retelling of a real tragedy.
