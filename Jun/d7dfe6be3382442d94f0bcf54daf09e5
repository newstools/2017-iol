Washington - Paloma Contreras, an interior decorator and design blogger, is redesigning the master bedroom of her Houston home, a process she says is crucial because of a bedroom's restorative nature. "More than any other room, one's bedroom is one's sanctuary," Contreras said. "As such, it should reflect your style and feel like a respite from the hustle and bustle of everyday life." We asked her to pick a collection of bedroom pieces that mix well together and provide that valuable sense of tranquility. Her selections "can lean modern or traditional" and "exude a timeless sense of style," she added.
