Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says he disagrees with some of the conclusions made in the report commissioned by the South African Council of Churches which implicated him. Gigaba said in a statement on Tuesday that he shares the concerns raised about corruption in the report which was released last week. Some of the allegations against Gigaba include that he played a central role in appointing Gupta-linked associates into key state-owned enterprises when he was the minister in the department. But Gigaba has dismissed this, saying he also supports the ANC NEC's decision to push for the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture. "We have great appreciation for the unique role that the faith-based organisations such as SACC play in building a united to defeat the malaise of corruption," said Gigaba. "Transformation of our society to create a more inclusive economy has to be done while observing the highest standards corporate governance. Inclusive growth is meant to achieve broad-based transformation, mobilise investment, and create jobs for the benefit of South African citizens," said Gigaba. The minister said he is also concerned about media reports on television channel ANN7 which alleged that an internal Treasury audit into government's integrated financial system revealed financial mismanagement at the department. @ZintleMahlati  Politics and Development Hub
