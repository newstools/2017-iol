The 29-year-old actress, who was announced as the spokesperson for the beauty and skincare brand in 2013 features in L'OrÃ©al's new True Match foundation commercial for their 'Your Skin, Your Story' campaign, and the blonde beauty has admitted the advert has strongly "moved" her because it celebrates every woman's "similarities and our differences".  The former 'Gossip Girl' star shared a picture of her portrait in black and white on her Instagram account with a quote from her emblazoned across it, which read "We are different shapes and sizes. We are different colours. We are beautiful inside and out. We are kind. We are brave. We are vulnerable. We are flawed. We are perfect. We are worth it".

Now more than ever that simple phrase is a powerful reminder to us all, as woman are coming together, rising up, and standing for their value. We are worth it. We are different shapes and sizes. We are different colors. We are beautiful inside and out. We are kind. We are brave. We are vulnerable. We are flawed. We are perfect. We are worth it. And we each have a story to tell. Which is why I was so moved by the â€˜Your Skin, Your Storyâ€™ campaign. It's a beautiful illustration that we are in this together. And we are listening to one another and celebrating each other for both our similarities, and our differences. Now THAT'S beautiful." -Me :) #worthsharing #truematch LINK IN BIO FOR A SNEAK PEAK ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ©ðŸ’‹ A photo posted by Blake Lively (@blakelively) on Jan 8, 2017 at 3:34pm PST Speaking in the clip, she said: "I am from Southern California.
