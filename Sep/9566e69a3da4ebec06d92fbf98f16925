I’m Mufasa, so people should come and check it out,” Cassper  confirmed. Cassper says the tickets are really cheap, so everyone must join him as he makes "history". “I reach out to the poorest of poor, and I also reach out to the richest of rich. I know that there’s some people who want to go out there and be comfortable,  they can pay 500 bucks and go in Golden Circle, and then I know there’s some people who have to save for three months for 100 bucks.” he said Cassper getting fit for #FillUpOrlandoStadium IOL
