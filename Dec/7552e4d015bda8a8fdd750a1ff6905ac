DJ Khaled has documented getting stuck on a jet ski and getting rescued by Drake and P Diddy on Instagram. The 'I'm the One' hitmaker - who has 14-month-old son Asahd with fiancee Nicole Tuck - was using the speedy watercraft to get to fellow rapper P Diddy's house, but later had to be rescued by the 'Last Night' star and Drake after he crashed into a tree in the water, which left him stuck for some time. The 42-year-old star - real name Khaled Mohamed Khaled - documented the entire incident with his 8.7 million Instagram followers on Wednesday.
