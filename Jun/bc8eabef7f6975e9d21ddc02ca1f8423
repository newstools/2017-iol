Every Sunday TANNIE EVITA peeled the onion of South African history, exposing the lies and the fantasies and delving deeper into where we were and where we are going. "Tannie Evita Praat Kaktus" became the longest running show in South Africa. At last it has left the Swartland to confront one of the most controversial issues in our democracy: the real history of South Africa and the right to laugh at the lies.
