More and more travellers to South Africa want a local experience. This means that they want to engage more with locals, enjoy their cuisines and visit hidden gems that only South Africans know. 
 
Those local experiences that foreign travellers experience is what makes South Africa one of the destinations to visit. Here are some ways to travel like a local when in South Africa:
 
Chat to the locals 
 
Travellers often say how warm and friendly South African people are, which is why they should not shy away from striking a conversation with them. Engaging with locals helps foreigners to understand the customs and traditions. You never know what you may discover when you speak with them. Learn the lingo 
 
You do not have the full South African experience if you do not learn the lingo. Locals are always willing to teach foreigners their language, from their greetings to their goodbyes. There are 11 official languages in South Africa, from isiZulu, Sotho, Xhosa and Afrikaans, so you are spoilt for choice when discovering a new language. 
 
Take advantage of local cuisines 
 
There are plenty food markets and eateries that showcases South African cuisine. Try South African favourites like pap and vleis, kota, milk tart, bunny chow, biltong and sorghum beer. 
 
Try renting out a house rather than booking a hotel 
 
Living among local people is a truly authentic way to experience South Africa. With the rise of Airbnb, it's easier to find houses that suit your budget and your family needs. Having a holiday home helps you to have your own space, engage with neighbours and have a braai or pool party.
