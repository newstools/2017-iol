Europe travellers who struggle to find cool beer hangouts can breathe a sigh of relief thanks to Lufthansa. The airline has developed an European Beer Map that showcase what's on offer in certain towns and cities in Europe. With just a click of a button, users can find cool beer spot anywhere in Europe. The map suggests  a wide variety of beverages from a foamy Guinness at Dublin’s renowned Porterhouse to the local Farmhouse ales at Pub Šnekutis in Vilnius. This follows the launch of the European Ice-Cream Map earlier this year. The spots were selected by users, so you know it's going to be good. The Director of Marketing for Europe, Middle East and Africa,  Kristina Öström, said the German airline took pride in its heritage and traditions, such as celebrating Oktoberfest and their well-known German beer culture. “When we decided to launch this beer map, we wanted to share our passion with the rest of the world – starting from a free beer served on Lufthansa flights worldwide.” She said the beer map took a month to create. “We wanted to create a map that showcased where locals meet and socialise. The selection of locations was based on own travel experiences, tips from locals and colleagues. “Our intention with this map is to assist travelers and fellow beer lovers to discover the best local brews while traveling around Europe and get inspired on where to head for a drink during their next trip,” she said. The process is quite simple. Users can log onto the website, where they will be taken to the landing page that showcases the map with the different European countries. Users can navigate to their selected country and a range of spots will pop up. Access the map here: www.beermap.net
