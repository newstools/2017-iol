Durban - Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) on Thursday released a trading update, which showed that the company produced 610 000 ounces of metal-in-concentrate in the fourth quarter, a 2 percent quarterly improvement year-on-year. The group said the fourth quarter production is seasonally lower than the third quarter, due to the impact of the public holidays. Strong operational performances have been achieved by the retained own mines, with Mogalakwena up 5percent and Unki up 7percent, as well as from joint-venture operations BRPM and Kroondal. A record production for the quarter at Kroondal and strong production from BRPM was offset by lower production at Bokoni, due to closures of unprofitable production from UM2 and Vertical Shafts at the end of 2015.
