For many of us, travelling the world normally means red-eye flights and days spent in dark conference rooms – our only taste of what it would be like to spend quality time in that destination is a quick glimpse of a city park, street café or museum through our taxi window as we brave traffic between meetings. The fact that we are at the southern most tip of Africa, most business destinations are long haul providing an opportunity for travellers to extend their trips for leisure purposes, adding a day or two before or after their conference or meetings to spend some time exploring the sights. “For the effort and cost it takes to plan a business trip, it makes sense to spend a few additional days in your destination. Arriving a few days before you need to conduct your business also gives you an opportunity to relax and orientate yourself so that you ease in to your surrounds and are fresh and prepared to tackle your business trip with minimal inconvenience,” explains Flight Centre Business Travel Brand Leader, Ryan Potgieter. “If you’re worried about the additional expense and time, there are ways in which to enjoy bleisure in your destination without encroaching on your productivity and budget. You simply need to be smart in your travel planning and enlist the help of a travel management company to ensure you get the most benefit from your bleisure extension. Even something as obvious as booking a hotel with unlimited free WiFi can give you peace of mind when you’re away from the office.” Travelling for a conference or planning a business trip in 2018?

Says Potgieter: “Take a leaf out of the millennial playbook and mix a little leisure with your business so that you enhance your business travel and return home with more than jetlag and an overflowing list of ‘to dos’.”
