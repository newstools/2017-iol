As of today, Iberia is in the 4-star category of airlines audited by the Skytrax industry consulting firm.  Iberia’s Chairman and CEO, Luis Gallego, and the airline’s Customers Director, Carolina Martinoli, received the recognition by Skytrax while attending the Le Bourget air show in France, which will close on 25 June.  Skytrax awarded an additional star to Iberia after carrying out a detailed audit lasting three weeks and covering a comprehensive analysis of it short, medium and long-haul flights, as well as Iberia’s hub at Madrid airport T4   The inclusion of Iberia in the 4-star category reflects the airline’s high and consistent product standard and high levels of quality, service, and attention to customers by staff both in the air and on the ground at its hub in T4 of Madrid’s airport.  Iberia’s Chairman and CEO, Luis Gallego, has expressed his gratitude to all Iberia employees, “it was due chiefly to their efforts, determination, and capability that Iberia was able to improve our service to customers.”.   The airline’s Customers Director, Carolina Martinoli, said “There are three reasons for the advance to a higher Skytrax ranking: a major improvement in punctuality, a total upgrade of our long-haul product in both Business and Economy, and the level of excellence we have achieved in our customer service”.   As part of its transformation process, Iberia is replacing a large part of its fleet, with an order of nearly 40 modern and efficient wide-bodied aircraft. It has also totally redesigned its Business and Economy seating sections, while launching the new, intermediate Premium Economy section on long-haul flights. Iberia was the first Spanish airline to equip its aircraft with Wi-Fi, and it has improved its service at every point of contact with the customer.   Steady advances in punctuality since 2013 made Iberia the world’s most punctual major airline in 2016. In the same year, the airline received the CAPA award for “the best airline transformation”.
