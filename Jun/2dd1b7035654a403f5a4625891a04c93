Washington - Saudi Foreign Minister Adel
al-Jubeir said on Tuesday that there would be no negotiations
over demands by the kingdom and other Arab states for Qatar to
stop supporting terrorism. Asked by reporters on a visit to Washington if the demands
were non-negotiable, Jubeir said: "Yes." "We made our point, we took our steps and it's up to the
Qataris to amend their behaviour and once they do things will be
worked out but if they don't they will remain isolated," Jubeir
said. If Qatar wanted to return to the Gulf Cooperation Council
fold, "they know what they have to do," he said. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt
imposed a boycott on Qatar three weeks ago, accusing it of
backing militants - then issued an ultimatum, including demands
it shut down a Turkish military base in Doha, shutting the Al
Jazeera TV channel and curbing ties with Iran. Qatar denies the allegations against it and says the demands
are aimed at curbing its sovereignty. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is scheduled to meet
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani
at the State Department on Tuesday. Reuters
