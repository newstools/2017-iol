Johannesburg - Outgoing African National Congress (ANC) secretary general, Gwede Mantashe, on Thursday said he had mixed emotions as he leaves behind a ''difficult and complex'' office. He made his comments ahead of the ANC's 54th National Conference in Johannesburg, which begins on Saturday and ends on Wednesday. ''Leaving an office I enjoyed for 10 years is a mixed feeling. It's a very difficult office, very complex ... you absorb blame for everything and not get any credit for anything ... and that's it, we have enjoyed it ... we are coming to an end, '' Mantashe told reporters at conference venue, Nasrec.

''We are quite happy that conference will go ahead, it will be successful, it won't collapse ... those who said it will collapse are probably disappointed already,'' said the ANC secretary general. ''It will be the most well organised, most engaging conference. We have the gala dinner tomorrow night and Saturday things will get running.''
