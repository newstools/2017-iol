Hyundai and Volkswagen have released teasers of their upcoming compact crossovers, which are set to be revealed imminently, and while the pair are not related in any way both are set to add even more variety to the rapidly expanding segment. Hyundai Kona Hyundai’s entrant will be called the Kona and the teaser pic above shows us its face for the first time. The Korean crossover is set to slot below the Tucson. But doesn’t Hyundai already have the Creta in that space? Yes, but the latter appears to have been developed more for emerging markets while the Kona looks to have markets such as Europe in its sights, where it’ll likely slot in somewhere between the Nissan Juke (which it resembles somewhat) and Toyota’s C-HR. Hyundai describes it as having a “progressive character” combined with the company’s new design identity. As the rest of the vehicle has yet to be revealed, we’ll have to take Hyundai’s word that the body styling is “aggressive”. Volkswagen T-Roc Also set to rival the C-HR at the funky end of the segment is Volkswagen’s T-Roc, seen in disguised prototype in the video above – which was shot right here in South Africa. Though, like most modern VWs, the T-Roc will be built on the company’s MQB modular platform, it is said to be quite closely related to the Audi Q2. It should boast a similar array of engines too, including 1-litre and 1.4-litre turbopetrols. VW is also reportedly working on an even smaller crossover, which will be closely based on the next-gen Polo. Given that the latter is going to be built in South Africa, don’t be surprised if in a few years time you see the little SUV streaming down the Uitenhage assembly line alongside its hatch cousin.
