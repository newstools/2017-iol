Award-winning South African DJ Black Coffee shared why he was unable assist two A-List music artists during a Metro FM interview on Friday. The internationally renowned DJ, real name Nkosinathi Maphumulo, revealed that Rihanna's team approached him while he was working with American singer Cassie to ask if they could use one of his songs for the 'Work' hitmakers album. Coffee explained that he sent them songs for consideration, but had to turn them down after they wanted to use the one he recorded for Cassie. However, all was not lost because he promised them a new song, which he is still working on. This isn't the first time US hitmakers have reached out to Coffee. Earlier this year, US producer Swiss Beatz contacted Coffee to record a song for American rapper Jay-Z's '4:44' album. "Swizz reached out and said Jay is looking for one song before he concludes his album. It freaked me out. I am in Milan, I couldn't sleep," explained the high profile DJ. "He literally called me: 'I spoke to Jay. Jay wants a song.' I couldn't sleep. Then I didn't work. I couldn't. How do you produce a song for Jay -Z? He kept saying: √ùo, man. I'm waiting'. I think I failed him but subconsciously I think I wanted to. I wasn't ready. "I don't work like that. I am not one of those producers who goes to the studio every day and have a list of songs to play people. I go into studio and craft a beat with the person," he added. Coffee previously collaborated with the likes of Alicia Keys and Drake. He is also set to release a new collab with Usher.
